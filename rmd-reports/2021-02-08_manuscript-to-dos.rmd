# introduction

- [ ] pragmatism argument
- [ ] introduction to other relevant bits of literature
- [ ] very clear on what the contributions of this work are
    - _this will take a number of re works, so I don't have to get it perfect each time_


# Example introduction

- [ ] is this worth having a separate section?
- [ ] introduce the survival example 
- [ ] emphasise why each of the examples is interesting / what angle of the problem it explores.

# Model specification

- [x] things like 'appropriate joint model' and 'valid joint density' are imprecise and should be removed
- [ ] don't think using the word 'adjacent' / describing it is worth the effort.
    - I later think otherwise
- [x] bit more specific about the conditions for the submodels
    - [ ] this is covered in 3.2
- [ ] '(co)variance \sigma' is not correct
- [ ] missing closing parentheses after Equation (7)

# model coherency

- [ ] rewrite
    - [x] decide if we should use \cap in this section
        - no.
- [ ] cut conditional commutativity
- [ ] decide if this goes in the appendix or in the main text

# posterior estimation 

- [ ] citations for multi-stage samplers 
- [ ] include normal approximations an propagation of point estimates 
- [ ] is the maths really necessary? might be worth putting into the appendix and just summarising in the main text

# examples

- [ ] emphasises that the examples are proofs of existence / people already modelling in this manner 
- [ ] the second model can't really be done as a joint model? You'd have to do some form of gibbs? nah, but it would be difficult to get it all working simultaneously.
- [ ] the work to get the second example working / showing what we want it to show.

# conclusion

- [ ] 7.2 and 7.3 are subs of 7.1
- [ ] 7.5 is probably not worth discussing again.
- [ ] 7.7 is the most interesting imo
- [ ] 7.6 is worth discussing and citing.
