# Models

There are $i = 1, \ldots, N$ individuals (icustays) in the data set.
Each individual is admitted to the ICU at time $0$, and is discharged or expires at time $C_{i}$.

## P/F ratio model (B-spline): $\pd_{1}$

Each individual has $j = 1, \ldots, J_{i}$ P/F ratio observations $z_{i, j}$ at times $t_{i, j}$ where $\boldsymbol{z}_{i} = (z_{i, 1}, \ldots, z_{i, J_{i}})$ and $\boldsymbol{t}_{i} = (t_{i, 1}, \ldots, t_{i, J_{i}})$.
We choose to model the P/F ratio using a B-spline of degree 3, with 2 boundary knots and 7 internal knots, and do not include an intercept column in the spline basis.
The lower boundary knot is placed at $\min(\boldsymbol{t_{i}})$ and the upper boundary knot is placed at $\max(\boldsymbol{t_{i}})$.
The internal knots are evenly spaced between the two boundary knots.
These choices result in $k = 1, \ldots, 10$ spline basis terms per individual, with coefficients $\zeta_{i, k}$ where $\boldsymbol{\zeta}_{i} = (\zeta_{i, 1}, \ldots, \zeta_{i, 10})$.
We denote the individual specific B-spline basis evaluated at time $t_{i, j}$ as $B_{i}(t_{i, j}) \in \mathbb{R}_{+} \cup \{0\}$.

An individual's P/F data are standardised to improve computational performance.
That is to say we actually observe $\tilde{z}_{i, j}$, which are then rescaled by each individual's mean $\overline{z}_{i}$ and standard deviation $\hat{s}_{i}$ such that $z_{i, j} = \frac{\tilde{z}_{i, j} - \overline{z}_{i}}{\hat{s}_{i}}$.
The threshold for respiratory failure is rescaled for each individual, i.e. $\tau_{i} = \frac{300 - \overline{z}_{i}}{\hat{s}_{i}}$.

We write the submodel
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
  z_{i, j} = \beta_{0, i} + B_{i}(t_{i, j})\boldsymbol{\zeta}_{i} + \varepsilon_{i, j} \\
  \beta_{0, i} \sim \text{N}(0, 1^2), \,\, \varepsilon_{i, j} \sim t_{5}(0, \omega), \,\,  \omega \sim \text{N}_{+}(0, 1^2).
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
For the spline basis coefficients we set $\zeta_{i, 1} \sim \text{N}(0, 0.5^2)$, and for $k = 2, \ldots, 10$ we employ a random-walk prior $\zeta_{i, k} \sim \text{N}(\zeta_{i, k - 1}, 0.5^2)$.

Individuals experience either the respiratory failure event ($d_{i} = 1$) or are censored ($d_{i} = 0$) at time $C_{i}$.
The event time $T_{i}$ is defined as the solution to the following optimisation problem
\begin{equation}
  T_{i} = \min_{t} \left\{
    \tau_{i} = \beta_{0, i} + B_{i}(t)\boldsymbol{\zeta}_{i}
    \mid
    t \in [\max(0, \min(\boldsymbol{t_{i}})), \max(\boldsymbol{t_{i}})]
  \right\},
  \label{eqn:event_time_model_def}
\end{equation}
where solutions to $\tau_{i} = \beta_{0, i} + B_{i}(t)\boldsymbol{\zeta}_{i}$ are obtained using the multiple root finder of @soetaert_rootsolve_2020.
If no solutions are found then we assume the individual is censored, and set $T_{i} = C_{i}$ and $d_{i} = 0$.

We define $\phi_{1 \cap 2} = (\{T_{i}, d_{i}\}_{i = 1}^{N})$ noting that $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{N}\pd_{1, i}(T_{i}, d_{i})$.
It is also important to note that $\pd_{1, i}(T_{i}, d_{i})$ conditions on each individual's length of stay (in specifying the location of the knots), as well as the range, mean, and standard deviation of the P/F data (by standardising the $\tilde{z}_{i, j}$).
The analytic form of $\pd_{1, i}(T_{i}, d_{i})$ is not available and must be estimated, which we discuss in Section \ref{estimating-submodel-prior-marginal-distributions}.

To align with our chained melding notation we define $Y_{1} = (\{\boldsymbol{z}_{i}, \boldsymbol{t}_{i}\}_{i = 1}^{N})$ and $\psi_{1} = (\{\beta_{0, i}, \boldsymbol{\zeta}_{i}\}_{i = 1}^{N}, \omega)$.

## Cumulative fluid model (piecewise linear) $\pd_{3}$

Each individual has $l = 1, \ldots, L_{i}$ 24-hourly fluid balance observations[^fluidobs], which are used to compute the cumulative fluid balance data $x_{i, l}$ with with $\boldsymbol{x}_{i} = (x_{i, 1}, \ldots, x_{i, L_{i}})$.
These data are measured in litres and observed at times $u_{i, l}$ with $\boldsymbol{u}_{i} = (u_{i, 1}, \ldots, u_{i, L_{i}})$.
We use a piecewise linear model for these data, with with slope $\eta_{1, i}^{b}$ before the breakpoint at time $\kappa_{i}$, and slope $\eta_{1, i}^{a}$ after the breakpoint.
Mathematically,
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
  x_{i, l} = \eta_{0, i} + \eta^{b}_{1, i}(u_{i, l} - \kappa_{i})\boldsymbol{1}_{\{u_{i, l} < \kappa_{i}\}} + \eta^{a}_{1, i}(u_{i, l} - \kappa_{i})\boldsymbol{1}_{\{u_{i, l} \geq \kappa_{i}\}} + \epsilon_{i, l} \\
  \eta^{b}_{1, i} \sim \text{Gamma}(1.53, 0.24), \,\, \eta^{a}_{1, i} \sim \text{Gamma}(1.53, 0.24), \\
  \epsilon_{i, l} \sim \text{N}(0, \sigma^{2}_{x}),  \,\, \sigma_{x} \sim \text{N}_{+}(0, 5^2).
  \label{eqn:piecewise-fluid-model}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

The parameters for the gamma prior for $\eta^{b}_{1, i}$ and $\eta^{a}_{1, i}$ are obtained by assuming that the 2.5-, 50-, and 97.5- percentiles are at 0.5, 5, and 20 [@belgorodski_rriskdistributions_2017].
A slope of $0.5$ (i.e. the change in cumulative fluid balance per day) is unlikely but possible due to missing data; a slope of $20$ is also unlikely but possible as extremely unwell patients can have very high respiratory rates and thus require large fluid inputs.

The prior for the breakpoint $\kappa_{i}$ is derived as follows.
Define $u_{i, (1)} = \min(\boldsymbol{u}_{i})$ and $u_{i, (n)} = \max(\boldsymbol{u}_{i})$, with $r_{i} = u_{i, (n)} - u_{i, (1)}$.
We reparameterise the breakpoint by noting that $\kappa_{i} = \kappa^{\text{raw}}_{i}r_{i} + u_{i, (1)}$, where $\kappa^{\text{raw}} \in [0, 1]$.
We then set $\kappa^{\text{raw}}_{i} \sim \text{Beta}(5, 5)$ to regularise the breakpoint towards the middle of each individual's stay in ICU.
This is crucial to ensure the submodel is identifiable when there is no evidence of a breakpoint in the data.

Specifying a prior for $\eta_{0, i}$ is difficult because $\eta_{0, i}$ is the cumulative fluid balance at $\kappa_{i}$, and thus depends on the length of stay.
Instead, we reparameterise $\eta_{0, i}$ to be a function of the y-intercept $\eta_{0, i}^{\text{raw}}$
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{0, i} =
    (\eta_{0, i}^{\text{raw}} + \eta^{b}_{1, i} \kappa_{i}) \boldsymbol{1}_{\{0 < \kappa_{i}\}} +
    (\eta_{0, i}^{\text{raw}} + \eta^{a}_{1, i} \kappa_{i}) \boldsymbol{1}_{\{0 \geq \kappa_{i}\}}.
\end{equation}
We place a $\text{LogNormal}(1.61, 0.47^2)$ prior on $\eta_{0, i}^{\text{raw}}$.
These values are obtained assuming that, a priori, the $2.5\%, 50\%$, and $99\%$ percentiles of $\eta_{0, i}^{\text{raw}}$ are $0.5, 5$, and $15$ respectively [@belgorodski_rriskdistributions_2017].
This is a broad prior that reflects the numerous possible admission routes into the ICU.
We expect those admitted from the wards to have little pre-admission fluid data.
Those admitted from the operating theatre often have their in-theatre fluid input recorded after admission into the ICU, with no easy way to distinguish these records in the data.

To align with our melding notation we define $m_{i}(t) = \eta_{0, i} + \eta^{b}_{1, i}(t - \kappa_{i})\boldsymbol{1}_{\{t < \kappa_{i}\}} + \eta^{a}_{1, i}(t - \kappa_{i})\boldsymbol{1}_{\{t \geq \kappa_{i}\}}$, with $\phi_{2 \cap 3} = \left(\{\eta^{b}_{1, i}, \eta^{a}_{1, i}, \kappa_{i}\}_{i = 1}^{N}\right)$, $Y_{3} = (\{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \boldsymbol{u}_{i}\}_{i = 1}^{N})$, and $\psi_{3} = (\{\eta_{0, i}\}_{i = 1}^{N}, \sigma^{2}_{x})$.
Note that we have explicit, analytic priors for the components of $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$.
Hence,
\begin{equation}
  \pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{N} \pd(\eta^{b}_{1, i}) \pd(\eta^{a}_{1, i}) \pd(\kappa_{i}), \,\, \text{with} \,\,\,
  \pd(\kappa_{i}) = \pd_{\kappa^{\text{raw}}_{i}}(\frac{\kappa_{i} - u_{i, (1)}}{r_{i}}) \frac{1}{r_{i}}
\end{equation}
by the change of variables formula.

## Competing risks survival model $\pd_{2}$

Individuals experience one of two competing events: respiratory failure ($d_{i} = 1$), or death or discharge $(d_{i} = 2)$.
The competing risks framework [see @kalbfleisch_statistical_2002 for an introduction] requires hazards that are specific to each type of event.
We use a Weibull hazard with shape parameter $\gamma_{1}$ for the respiratory failure (RF) event times, and assume a constant hazard $\gamma_{2}$ for the death or discharge (DD) event times.
Denote $\boldsymbol{\gamma} = (\gamma_{1}, \gamma_{2})$.
All individuals have $b = 1, \ldots, B$ baseline (time invariant) covariates $w_{i, b}$ with $\boldsymbol{w}_{i} = (1, w_{i, 1}, \ldots, w_{i, B})$(i.e. including an intercept term), and coefficient $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^{B + 1}$.
The RF hazard is assumed to be influenced by these covariates and the rate of increase in the cumulative fluid balance.
The strength of the latter relationship is captured by $\alpha$.
Hence, the RF hazard is
\begin{gather}
  h_{i, 1}(T_{i}) = \gamma_{1} T_{i}^{\gamma_{1} - 1} \exp\left\{\boldsymbol{w}_{i}\theta + \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial T_{i}} m_{i}(T_{i})\right\} \\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial T_{i}} m_{i}(T_{i}) = \eta^{b}_{1, i}\boldsymbol{1}_{\{T_{i} < \kappa_{i}\}} + \eta^{a}_{1, i}\boldsymbol{1}_{\{T_{i} \geq \kappa_{i}\}},
\end{gather}
and the DD hazard is $h_{i, 2}(T_{i}) = \gamma_{2}$.
The RF cumulative hazard $H_{i, 1}(T_{i})$ is, for $T_{i} > \kappa_{i}$,
\begin{equation}
  H_{i, 1}(T_{i})
  = \int_{0}^{T_{i}} h_{i, 1}(u) \text{d}u
  = \exp\{\boldsymbol{w}_{i}\theta\}
    \left[
      \exp\left\{
        \alpha \eta^{b}_{1, i}
      \right\}
      \kappa_{i}^{\gamma}
      +
      \exp\left\{
        \alpha \eta^{a}_{1, i}
      \right\}
      (T_{i}^{\gamma} - \kappa_{i}^{\gamma})
    \right],
\end{equation}
and for $T_{i} < \kappa_{i}$
\begin{equation}
  H_{i, 1}(T_{i})
  = \int_{0}^{T_{i}} h_{i}(u) \text{d}u
  = T_{i}^{\gamma} \exp\{\boldsymbol{w}_{i}\theta + \alpha \eta^{b}_{1, i}\}.
\end{equation}
The hazard-specific survival functions are $S_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i}) = \exp\{-H_{i, d_{i}}(t)\}$, and the overall survival probability is
\begin{equation}
  S_{i}(T_{i}) = \exp\left\{-\sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} H_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i})\right\}.
\end{equation}
Because there are no censored event times, the likelihood for this competing risks model is
\begin{equation}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\gamma}, \boldsymbol{\theta}, \alpha, \kappa_{i}, \eta_{1, i}^{b}, \eta_{1, i}^{a}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) = h_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i}) S_{i}(T_{i}), \\
\end{equation}
where we suppress the dependence on the parameters on the right hand side for brevity.
Our priors are
\begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{\gamma} \sim \text{N}_{+}(0, \boldsymbol{I}_{2}), \, \,
  \theta_{1} \sim \text{N}(\hat{E}, 1^2), \, \,
  (\theta_{2}, \ldots, \theta_{B + 1}) \sim \text{N}(0, \boldsymbol{I}_{B}), \, \,
  \alpha \sim \text{N}(0, 1^2),
  \label{eqn:surv-submodel-prior-def}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{E}$ is the log of the crude event rate [@brilleman_bayesian_2020], and $\boldsymbol{I}_{p}$ is the $p \times p$ identity matrix.
We adopt the same priors as the cumulative fluid balance submodel for $\kappa_{i}, \eta_{1, i}^{b}$, and $\eta_{1, i}^{a}$.

# Estimating submodel prior marginal distributions

We must estimate $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ and $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$.
Because these distributions are functions of discrete and continuous parameters, and some of the latter have different supports, standard kernel density estimation as suggested by @goudie_joining_2019 is inappropriate.
Instead we fit appropriate parametric mixture distributions using Monte Carlo samples from the priors.

## PF submodel

We approximate $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ using spike-and-slab mixture distributions, with a spike at $C_{i}$ for the censored events and a beta distribution for the rescaled event times.
Monte Carlo samples of $T_{i}$ and $d_{i}$ are obtained from $\pd_{1, i}(T_{i}, d_{i})$ by drawing $\beta_{0, i}$ and $\boldsymbol{\zeta}_{i}$ from their respective prior distributions and then solving \eqref{eqn:event_time_model_def}.
Mathematically,
\begin{equation}
  \widehat{\pd}_{1}(T_{i}, d_{i}) =
    \widehat{\pi}_{i} \, \text{Beta}\left(\frac{T_{i}}{C_{i}}; \widehat{a}, \widehat{b}\right) \frac{1}{C_{i}} \boldsymbol{1}_{\{d_{i} = 1\}} +
    (1 - \widehat{\pi}_{i}) \boldsymbol{1}_{\{d_{i} = 2, T_{i} = C_{i}\}}
  \label{eqn:pf-event-time-prior-dist}
\end{equation}
where $\widehat{\pi}_{i}, \widehat{a}_{i}$ and $\widehat{b}_{i}$ are maximum likelihood estimates obtained using the prior predictive samples.
Estimates of $\pd_{1, i}(T_{i}, d_{i})$ are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:pf_prior_fit}.

```{r pf_prior_fit, fig.cap = "Fitted distribution (curve) and Monte Carlo samples drawn from the prior (histogram) for a subset of the individuals in the cohort. The height of the atom at $C_{i}$ (red bar) has been set to $1 - \\widehat{\\pi}_{i}$"}
knitr::include_graphics("../plots/mimic-example/pf-prior-plot-small.png")
```

## Survival submodel

Our estimate of $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$ relies on the fact that $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{N}\pd_{2, i}(T_{i}, d_{i}, \kappa_{i}, \eta^{b}_{1, i}, \eta^{a}_{1, i})$.
We focus on estimating $\pd_{2, i}(T_{i}, d_{i}, \kappa_{i}, \eta^{b}_{1, i}, \eta^{a}_{1, i})$ for each individual and taking the product of these estimates.

Drawing samples from $\pd_{2, i}(T_{i}, d_{i}, \kappa_{i}, \eta^{b}_{1, i}, \eta^{a}_{1, i})$ is a non-trivial task.
We use the methodology of @crowther_simulating_2013 as implemented in @brilleman_simulate_2021.

An inspection of the samples reveals correlation between $(T_{i}, d_{i})$ and $(\kappa_{i}, \eta^{b}_{1, i}, \eta^{a}_{1, i})$ that we would like to capture in our estimate.
To do so, we define transformed versions of the continuous parameters, which have support on $\mathbb{R}$ (which we call the unconstrained parameters)
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{T}_{i} = \text{Logit}\left(\frac{T_{i}}{C_{i}}\right), \quad
  \tilde{\kappa}_{i} = \text{Logit}\left(\frac{\kappa_{i} - u_{i, (1)}}{u_{i, (n)} - u_{i, (1)}}\right), \quad
  \tilde{\eta}^{b}_{1, i} = \log(\eta^{b}_{1, i}), \quad
  \tilde{\eta}^{a}_{1, i} = \log(\eta^{a}_{1, i})
\end{equation}

These are similar to before, but there is less difference between the method

# Pooling the priors

Once we have expressions or estimates of the prior marginal distributions, we need to:

- Decide what type of pooling to use (probably all of them and compare)
- Choose pooling weights, and run some kind of prior predictive check?
- Apportion the pooled prior over the stages of the multi-stage sampler, and which stage to divide by the marginals.

# A comparison with the competing risk approach

An initially appealing approach is to consider a competing risks model for $\pd_{2}$, where each individual experiences either the respiratory failure event or the competing, non-independent event of death or discharge.
However, issues arise due to the need to practically align the supports of $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ and $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$, which requires conditioning on $C_{i}$ (the length of stay) in $\pd_{2}$.
Conditional on $C_{i}$, the death or discharge event can only happen at a known, fixed time, which violates the competing risk assumption (that each event can occur at any moment in time the individual is exposed to both risks).
In light of this, we feel that it is more correct to consider the time of death or discharge as a censoring time.
Standard survival analyses arguments tell us that these approaches are equivalent.
However, these arguments make the key assumption that the survival times and indicators $(T_{i}, d_{i})$ are known quantities.
This assumption is not valid in our example, and below we show why this invalidates the usual equivalence between the competing risk and censoring approaches.

Suppose that each individual $i$ experiences one of $d_{i} = 1, 2$ competing risks.
We observe $\{T_{i}, d_{i}\}$, where $d_{i} = 1$ indicates that individual $i$ experienced respiratory failure at time $T_{i}$.
If $d_{i} = 2$ then individual $i$ expired or was discharged at time $T_{i}$, noting that this event must occur at time $C_{i}$.
Each cause-specific hazard has parameters $\theta_{d_{i}}$ and we denote the hazard $h_{i, d_{i}}(t \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})$.
Denote $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\theta_{1}, \theta_{2})$ and assume only one such event can occur at a time so that
\begin{gather}
  h_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) = \sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} h_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}), \\
  \begin{aligned}
  H_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})
    &= \int_{0}^{T_{i}} \sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} h_{i, d_{i}}(u \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \text{d}u \\
    &= \sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} \int_{0}^{T_{i}} h_{i, d_{i}}(u \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \text{d}u \\
    &= \sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} H_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}),
  \end{aligned} \\
  S_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})
    = \exp\left\{-H_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})\right\}
    = \exp\left\{-\sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} H_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})\right\}.
\end{gather}
As per Equation (8.8) in @kalbfleisch_statistical_2002 the likelihood function for a specific individual is
\begin{align*}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})
    &= h_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) S_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \\
    &= h_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \exp\left\{-\sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} H_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})\right\}.
\end{align*}

It is now necessary to assume

- that there are no shared elements in $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$ and they are a priori independent,
- that $\theta_{2}$ is not of interest, i.e. we wish to integrate/marginalise $\theta_{2}$ out of the likelihood.

The model (given covariates $\boldsymbol{w}_{i}$) is

\begin{equation}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i}, \boldsymbol{\theta} \mid \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) =
    \pd(T_{i}, d_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})\pd(\boldsymbol{\theta}).
\end{equation}

We are interested in the following marginal

\begin{equation}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i}, \theta_{1} \mid \boldsymbol{w}_{i})
  = \int \pd(T_{i}, d_{i}, \boldsymbol{\theta} \mid \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \text{d}\theta_{2}
  = \int h_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) S_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \pd(\theta_{1}) \pd(\theta_{2}) \text{d}\theta_{2}.
\end{equation}
If $d_{i} = 1$
\begin{equation}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i}, \theta_{1} \mid \boldsymbol{w}_{i})
  = h_{i, 1}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{1}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) S_{i, 1}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{1}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \pd(\theta_{1}) \int S_{i, 2}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{2}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \pd(\theta_{2}) \text{d} \theta_{2},
  \label{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-one}
\end{equation}
and if $d_{i} = 2$
\begin{equation}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i}, \theta_{1} \mid \boldsymbol{w}_{i})
  = S_{i, 1}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{1}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \pd(\theta_{1}) \int h_{i, 2}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{2}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) S_{i, 2}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{2}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \pd(\theta_{2}) \text{d} \theta_{2}.
  \label{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-two}
\end{equation}
Standard survival analyses consider $T_{i}$ as data.
Under this assumption the integrals in \eqref{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-one} and \eqref{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-two} are constants that do not depend on the parameters of interest, and can be ignored when maximising the likelihood for $\theta_{1}$.
The remaining components of \eqref{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-one} and \eqref{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-two} comprise the likelihood that would be obtained by considering all non $d_{i} = 1$ events as censored.
However, in our case $T_{i}$ is a parameter, and hence the integrals are non-ignorable functions of $T_{i}$.
This implies that the censoring model and the competing risks model are not equivalent, which we see in practice when comparing the posterior distributions for $\theta_{1}$ under both models.

# Calculating the cumulative fluid balance from the raw fluid data

In the raw fluid data each patient has $\tilde{l} = 1, \ldots, \tilde{L}_{i}$ observations.
Each observation $\tilde{x}_{i, \tilde{l}}$ is typically a small fluid administration (e.g. an injection of some medicine in saline solution), or a fluid discharge (almost always urine excretion).
The observations have corresponding observation times $\tilde{u}_{i, \tilde{l}}$, with $\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i} = \{\tilde{u}_{i, 1}, \ldots, \tilde{u}_{i, \tilde{L}_{i}}\}$ and $\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}_{i} = \{\tilde{x}_{i, 1}, \ldots, \tilde{x}_{i, \tilde{L}_{i}}\}$.
We code the fluid administrations/inputs as positive values, and the excretions/outputs as negative values.
Each patient has an enormous number of raw fluid observations $(L_{i} \ll \tilde{L}_{i})$ and it is computationally infeasible to consider them all at once.
Because the time scale of interest is typically a number of days, we aggregate the raw fluid observations into 24-hourly changes in fluid balance.
From these 24-hourly changes we calculate the cumulative fluid balance.

Mathematically, we define an ordered integer-vector of boundary values
\begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{b}_{i} = (\lfloor \min\{\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i}\} \rfloor,  \lfloor \min\{\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i}\} \rfloor + 1, \ldots, \lceil \max\{\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i}\} \rceil),
\end{equation}
noting that $\dim(\boldsymbol{b}_{i}) = L_{i} + 1$.
The raw fluid observations are then divided up into $L_{i}$ subsets of $\{\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}_{i}, \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i}\}$ based on which boundary values the observation falls in between:
\begin{equation}
  B_{i, l} = \left\{
    \{\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}_{i}, \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i}\}
    \mid
    b_{i, l} \leq \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i} < b_{i, l + 1}
  \right\},
\end{equation}
for $l = 1, \ldots, L_{i}$.
Denote $N^{B}_{i, l} = \lvert B_{i, l} \rvert \mathop{/} 2$ (dividing by two as $B_{i, l}$ contains both the observation and the observation time).
The $l$\textsuperscript{th} 24-hourly fluid change $\Delta_{i, l}$ and corresponding observation time $u_{i, l}$ can then be computed as
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{i, l} = \sum_{s = 1}^{N^{B}_{i, l}} \tilde{x}_{i, s}, \,\, \text{s.t.} \,\, \tilde{x}_{i, s} \in B_{i, l}, \qquad
  u_{i, l} = \frac{1}{N^{B}_{i, l}} \sum_{s = 1}^{N^{B}_{i, l}} \tilde{u}_{i, s}, \,\, \text{s.t.} \,\, \tilde{u}_{i, s} \in B_{i, l}.
\end{equation}
Finally, the 24-hourly cumulative fluid balance data are computed by $x_{i, l} = \sum_{s = 1}^{l} \Delta_{i, s}$, and we assume they too are observed at $u_{i, l}$.
