# Comparison to point estimate

- comparing chained melding to the point estimate approximation and the hybrids
- Seems like the bulk of the uncertainty comes from the uncertain event time? But there is still more uncertainty when the event times are fixed and the other things vary? I am missing something here.

```{r prop, fig.cap = "Posterior of $\\psi_{2}$ under melding and propagating the subposterior medians"}
knitr::include_graphics("../plots/surv-example/psi-2-method-comparison.png")
```
