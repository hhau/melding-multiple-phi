  abstract = {Summary. Alongside the development of meta-analysis as a tool for summarizing research literature, there is renewed interest in broader forms of quantitative synthesis that are aimed at combining evidence from different study designs or evidence on multiple parameters. These have been proposed under various headings: the confidence profile method, cross-design synthesis, hierarchical models and generalized evidence synthesis. Models that are used in health technology assessment are also referred to as representing a synthesis of evidence in a mathematical structure. Here we review alternative approaches to statistical evidence synthesis, and their implications for epidemiology and medical decision-making. The methods include hierarchical models, models informed by evidence on different functions of several parameters and models incorporating both of these features. The need to check for consistency of evidence when using these powerful methods is emphasized. We develop a rationale for evidence synthesis that is based on Bayesian decision modelling and expected value of information theory, which stresses not only the need for a lack of bias in estimates of treatment effects but also a lack of bias in assessments of uncertainty. The increasing reliance of governmental bodies like the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence on complex evidence synthesis in decision modelling is discussed.},

The longitudinal process is modelled using generalised linear mixed models, while the survival process is modelled using a parametric general hazard structure. The two processes are linked by sharing fixed and random effects, separating the effects that play a role at the time scale from those that affect the hazard scale. This strategy allows for the inclusion of non-linear and time-dependent effects while avoiding the need for numerical integration, which facilitates the implementation of the proposed joint model. We explore the use of flexible parametric distributions for modelling the baseline hazard function which can capture the basic shapes of interest in practice. We discuss prior elicitation based on the interpretation of the parameters. We present an extensive simulation study, where we analyse the inferential properties of the proposed models, and illustrate the trade-off between flexibility, sample size, and censoring. We also apply our proposal to two real data applications in order to demonstrate the adaptability of our formulation both in univariate time-to-event data and in a competing risks framework.

The cause-, i.e. event-specific hazards, completely determine the competing risk process, but simulation studies often fall back on the much criticized latent failure time model. Cause-specific hazard-driven simulation appears to be the exception; if done, usually only constant hazards are considered, which will be unrealistic in many medical situations. We explain simulating competing risks data based on possibly time-dependent cause-specific hazards. The simulation design is as easy as any other, relies on identifiable quantities only and adds to our understanding of the competing risks process. In addition, it immediately generalizes to more complex multistate models. We apply the proposed simulation design to computing the least false parameter of a misspecified proportional subdistribution hazard model, which is a research question of independent interest in competing risks. The simulation specifications have been motivated by data on infectious complications in stem-cell transplanted patients, where results from cause-specific hazards analyses were difficult to interpret in terms of cumulative event probabilities. The simulation illustrates that results from a misspecified proportional subdistribution hazard analysis can be interpreted as a time-averaged effect on the cumulative event probability scale.

We argue that a valid update of a prior belief distribution to a posterior can be made for parameters which are connected to observations through a loss function rather than the traditional likelihood function, which is recovered as a special case. Modern application areas make it increasingly challenging for Bayesians to attempt to model the true data-generating mechanism. For instance, when the object of interest is low dimensional, such as a mean or median, it is cumbersome to have to achieve this via a complete model for the whole data distribution. More importantly, there are settings where the parameter of interest does not directly index a family of density functions and thus the Bayesian approach to learning about such parameters is currently regarded as problematic. Our framework uses loss functions to connect information in the data to functionals of interest. The updating of beliefs then follows from a decision theoretic approach involving cumulative loss functions. Importantly, the procedure coincides with Bayesian updating when a true likelihood is known yet provides coherent subjective inference in much more general settings. Connections to other inference frameworks are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Survival data is encountered in a range of disciplines, most notably health and medical research. Although Bayesian approaches to the analysis of survival data can provide a number of benefits, they are less widely used than classical (e.g. likelihood-based) approaches. This may be in part due to a relative absence of user-friendly implementations of Bayesian survival models. In this article we describe how the rstanarm R package can be used to fit a wide range of Bayesian survival models. The rstanarm package facilitates Bayesian regression modelling by providing a user-friendly interface (users specify their model using customary R formula syntax and data frames) and using the Stan software (a C++ library for Bayesian inference) for the back-end estimation. The suite of models that can be estimated using rstanarm is broad and includes generalised linear models (GLMs), generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs), generalised additive models (GAMs) and more. In this article we focus only on the survival modelling functionality. This includes standard parametric (exponential, Weibull, Gompertz) and flexible parametric (spline-based) hazard models, as well as standard parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models. All types of censoring (left, right, interval) are allowed, as is delayed entry (left truncation), time-varying covariates, time-varying effects, and frailty effects. We demonstrate the functionality through worked examples. We anticipate these implementations will increase the uptake of Bayesian survival analysis in applied research.},

  abstract = {Background ARDS is an important clinical problem. The definition of ARDS requires testing of arterial blood gas to define the ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 (Pao2/Fio2 ratio). However, many patients with ARDS do not undergo blood gas measurement, which may result in underdiagnosis of the condition. As a consequence, a method for estimating Pao2 on the basis of noninvasive measurements is desirable. Methods Using data from three ARDS Network studies, we analyzed the enrollment arterial blood gas measurements to compare nonlinear with linear and log-linear imputation methods of estimating Pao2 from percent saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2). We compared mortality on the basis of various measured and imputed Pao2/Fio2 ratio cutoffs to ensure clinical equivalence. Results We studied 1,184 patients, in 707 of whom the Spo2{$~\leq$} 96{$\%$}. Nonlinear imputation from the Spo2/Fio2 ratio resulted in lower error than linear or log-linear imputation (P{$~<~$}.001) for patients with Spo2{$~\leq$} 96{$\%~$}but was equivalent to log-linear imputation in all patients. Ninety-day hospital mortality was 26{$\%~$}to 30{$\%$}, depending on the Pao2/Fio2 ratio, whether nonlinearly imputed or measured. On multivariate regression, the association between imputed and measured Pao2 varied by use of vasopressors and Spo2. Conclusions A nonlinear equation more accurately imputes Pao2/Fio2 from Spo2/Fio2 than linear or log-linear equations, with similar observed hospital mortality depending on Spo2/Fio2 ratio vs{$~$}measured Pao2/Fio2 ratios. While further refinement through prospective validation is indicated, a nonlinear imputation appears superior to prior approaches to imputation.},

For instance, in distributed `big data' problems, or when working under multi-party privacy constraints. Many existing approaches resort to approximating the individual sub-posteriors for practical necessity, then representing the resulting approximate posterior. The quality of the posterior approximation for these approaches is poor when the sub-posteriors fall out-with a narrow range of distributional form. Recently, a Fusion approach has been proposed which finds a direct and exact Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior (as opposed to the sub-posteriors), circumventing the drawbacks of approximate approaches. Unfortunately, existing Fusion approaches have a number of computational limitations, particularly when unifying a large number of sub-posteriors. In this paper, we generalise the theory underpinning existing Fusion approaches, and embed the resulting methodology within a recursive divide-and-conquer sequential Monte Carlo paradigm. This ultimately leads to a competitive Fusion approach, which is robust to increasing numbers of sub-posteriors.},

  abstract = {There has recently been considerable interest in addressing the problem of unifying distributed statistical analyses into a single coherent inference. This problem naturally arises in a number of situations, including in big-data settings, when working under privacy constraints, and in Bayesian model choice. The majority of existing approaches have relied upon convenient approximations of the distributed analyses. Although typically being computationally efficient, and readily scaling with respect to the number of analyses being unified, approximate approaches can have significant shortcomings -- the quality of the inference can degrade rapidly with the number of analyses being unified, and can be substantially biased even when unifying a small number of analyses that do not concur. In contrast, the recent Fusion approach of Dai et al. (2019) is a rejection sampling scheme which is readily parallelisable and is exact (avoiding any form of approximation other than Monte Carlo error), albeit limited in applicability to unifying a small number of low-dimensional analyses. In this paper we introduce a practical Bayesian Fusion approach. We extend the theory underpinning the Fusion methodology and, by embedding it within a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, we are able to recover the correct target distribution. By means of extensive guidance on the implementation of the approach, we demonstrate theoretically and empirically that Bayesian Fusion is robust to increasing numbers of analyses, and coherently unifying analyses which do not concur. This is achieved while being computationally competitive with approximate schemes.},

This surprisingly challenging problem arises in many settings (for instance, expert elicitation, multiview learning, distributed `big data' problems, etc.), but to date the framework and methodology proposed in this paper (Monte Carlo fusion) is the first general approach which avoids any form of approximation error in obtaining the unified inference. In this paper we focus on the key theoretical underpinnings of this new methodology, and simple (direct) Monte Carlo interpretations of the theory. There is considerable scope to tailor the theory introduced in this paper to particular application settings (such as the big data setting), construct efficient parallelised schemes, understand the approximation and computational efficiencies of other such unification paradigms, and explore new theoretical and methodological directions.},

A stronger version of this hyper Markov property is also studied. Our analysis starts by reconsidering the properties of Markov probabilities, using an abstract approach which thereafter proves equally applicable to the hyper Markov case. Next, it is shown constructively that hyper Markov laws exist, that they appear as sampling distributions of maximum likelihood estimators in decomposable graphical models, and also that they form natural conjugate prior distributions for a Bayesian analysis of these models. As examples we construct a range of specific hyper Markov laws, including the hyper multinomial, hyper Dirichlet and the hyper Wishart and inverse Wishart laws. These laws occur naturally in connection with the analysis of decomposable log-linear and covariance selection models.},

  abstract = {Combining distributions is an important issue in decision theory and Bayesian inference. Logarithmic pooling is a popular method to aggregate expert opinions by using a set of weights that reflect the reliability of each information source. However, the resulting pooled distribution depends heavily on set of weights given to each opinion/prior and thus careful consideration must be given to the choice of weights. In this paper we review and extend the statistical theory of logarithmic pooling, focusing on the assignment of the weights using a hierarchical prior distribution. We explore several statistical applications, such as the estimation of survival probabilities, meta-analysis and Bayesian melding of deterministic models of population growth and epidemics. We show that it is possible learn the weights from data, although identifiability issues may arise for some configurations of priors and data. Furthermore, we show how the hierarchical approach leads to posterior distributions that are able to accommodate prior-data conflict in complex models.},

  abstract = {We describe NIMBLE, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The NIMBLE language represents a compilable domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within R. This article provides an overview of the design and rationale for NIMBLE along with illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM). Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

The error structure is further complicated when analysis variables are derived as functions of two or more error-prone variables. Such errors can substantially impact estimates, yet we are unaware of methods that simultaneously account for errors in covariates and time-to-event outcomes. Using EHR data from 4217 patients, the hazard ratio for an AIDS-defining event associated with a 100 cell/mm3 increase in CD4 count at ART initiation was 0.74 (95{$\%$}CI: 0.68\textendash 0.80) using unvalidated data and 0.60 (95{$\%$}CI: 0.53\textendash 0.68) using fully validated data. Our goal is to obtain unbiased and efficient estimates after validating a random subset of records. We propose fitting discrete failure time models to the validated subsample and then multiply imputing values for unvalidated records. We demonstrate how this approach simultaneously addresses dependent errors in predictors, time-to-event outcomes, and inclusion criteria. Using the fully validated dataset as a gold standard, we compare the mean squared error of our estimates with those from the unvalidated dataset and the corresponding subsample-only dataset for various subsample sizes. By incorporating reasonably sized validated subsamples and appropriate imputation models, our approach had improved estimation over both the naive analysis and the analysis using only the validation subsample.},

Using a semiparametric likelihood-based approach, we present time to event models to estimate the association of one or more covariates with a error-prone, self-reported outcome. We present simulation studies to assess the effect of error in self-reported outcomes with regard to bias in the estimation of the regression parameter of interest.

Linkage and analysis of data across sources remains problematic due to lack of discriminatory and accurate identifiers, missing data and regulatory issues. Recent developments in data linkage methodology have concentrated on bias and analysis of linked data, novel approaches to organising relationships between databases and privacy-preserving linkage. Methodological Developments in Data Linkage brings together a collection of contributions from members of the international data linkage community, covering cutting edge methodology in this field. It presents opportunities and challenges provided by linkage of large and often complex datasets, including analysis problems, legal and security aspects, models for data access and the development of novel research areas. New methods for handling uncertainty in analysis of linked data, solutions for anonymised linkage and alternative models for data collection are also discussed. Key Features: Presents cutting edge methods for a topic of increasing importance to a wide range of research areas, with applications to data linkage systems internationally Covers the essential issues associated with data linkage today Includes examples based on real data linkage systems, highlighting the opportunities, successes and challenges that the increasing availability of linkage data provides Novel approach incorporates technical aspects of both linkage, management and analysis of linked data This book will be of core interest to academics, government employees, data holders, data managers, analysts and statisticians who use administrative data.

In this article, independent dose\textendash response experiments were repeated three times. Each experiment included replicates at investigated dose levels including control (no drug). We have developed a Bayesian hierarchical nonlinear regression model that accounts for variability between experiments, variability within experiments (i.e., replicates), and variability in the observed responses of the controls. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo to fit the model to the data and carry out posterior inference on quantities of interest (e.g., median inhibitory concentration IC 50). In addition, we have developed a method, based on Loewe additivity, that allows one to assess the presence of synergy with honest accounting of uncertainty. Extensive simulation studies show that our proposed approach is more reliable in declaring synergy compared to current standard analyses such as the median-effect principle/combination index method (Chou and Talalay, 1984, Advances in Enzyme Regulation 22, 27\textendash 55), which ignore important sources of variability and uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Bayesian models provide recursive inference naturally because they can formally reconcile new data and existing scientific information. However, popular use of Bayesian methods often avoids priors that are based on exact posterior distributions resulting from former studies. Two existing Recursive Bayesian methods are: Prior- and Proposal-Recursive Bayes. Prior-Recursive Bayes uses Bayesian updating, fitting models to partitions of data sequentially, and provides a way to accommodate new data as they become available using the posterior from the previous stage as the prior in the new stage based on the latest data. ProposalRecursive Bayes is intended for use with hierarchical Bayesian models and uses a set of transient priors in first stage independent analyses of the data partitions. The second stage of Proposal-Recursive Bayes uses the posteriors from the first stage as proposals in a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to fit the full model. We combine Prior- and Proposal-Recursive concepts to fit any Bayesian model, and often with computational improvements. We demonstrate our method with two case studies. Our approach has implications for big data, streaming data, and optimal adaptive design situations.},

The simplicity of the calculations required when performing conventional meta-analyses belies the parametric nature of the assumptions that justify them. In particular, the normal distribution is extensively, and often implicitly, assumed. Here, we review how the normal distribution is used in meta-analysis. We discuss when the normal distribution is likely to be adequate and also when it should be avoided. We discuss alternative and more advanced methods that make less use of the normal distribution. We conclude that statistical methods that make fewer normality assumptions should be considered more often in practice. In general, statisticians and applied analysts should understand the assumptions made by their statistical analyses. They should also be able to defend these assumptions. Our hope is that this article will foster a greater appreciation of the extent to which assumptions involving the normal distribution are made in statistical methods for meta-analysis.

  abstract = {In modern applications, statisticians are faced with integrating heterogeneous data modalities relevant for an inference, prediction, or decision problem. In such circumstances, it is convenient to use a graphical model to represent the statistical dependencies, via a set of connected "modules", each relating to a specific data modality, and drawing on specific domain expertise in their development. In principle, given data, the conventional statistical update then allows for coherent uncertainty quantification and information propagation through and across the modules. However, misspecification of any module can contaminate the estimate and update of others, often in unpredictable ways. In various settings, particularly when certain modules are trusted more than others, practitioners have preferred to avoid learning with the full model in favor of approaches that restrict the information propagation between modules, for example by restricting propagation to only particular directions along the edges of the graph. In this article, we investigate why these modular approaches might be preferable to the full model in misspecified settings. We propose principled criteria to choose between modular and full-model approaches. The question arises in many applied settings, including large stochastic dynamical systems, meta-analysis, epidemiological models, air pollution models, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics, and causal inference with propensity scores.},

A general formulation of censored-survival processes leads to the partition of all models into those based on noninformative and informative censoring. Nearly all statistical methods for censored data assume that censoring is noninformative. Topics considered within this class include: the relationships between three models for noninformative censoring, the use of likelihood methods for inferences about the distribution of survival time, the effects of censoring on the K-sample problem, and the effects of censoring on model testing. Also considered are several topics which relate to informative censoring models. These include: problems of nonidentifiability that can be encountered when attempting to assess a set of data for the type of censoring in effect, the consequences of falsely assuming that censoring is noninformative, and classes of informative censoring models.},

We use the term ``modality'' for each such acquisition framework. Due to the rich characteristics of natural phenomena, it is rare that a single modality provides complete knowledge of the phenomenon of interest. The increasing availability of several modalities reporting on the same system introduces new degrees of freedom, which raise questions beyond those related to exploiting each modality separately. As we argue, many of these questions, or ``challenges,'' are common to multiple domains. This paper deals with two key issues: ``why we need data fusion'' and ``how we perform it.'' The first issue is motivated by numerous examples in science and technology, followed by a mathematical framework that showcases some of the benefits that data fusion provides. In order to address the second issue, ``diversity'' is introduced as a key concept, and a number of data-driven solutions based on matrix and tensor decompositions are discussed, emphasizing how they account for diversity across the data sets. The aim of this paper is to provide the reader, regardless of his or her community of origin, with a taste of the vastness of the field, the prospects, and the opportunities that it holds.},

In this article, we first develop a Bayesian version for P-splines and generalize in a second step the approach in various ways. First, the assumption of constant smoothing parameters can be replaced by allowing the smoothing parameters to be locally adaptive. This is particularly useful in situations with changing curvature of the underlying smooth function or with highly oscillating functions. In a second extension, one-dimensional P-splines are generalized to two-dimensional surface fitting for modeling interactions between metrical covariates. In a last step, the approach is extended to situations with spatially correlated responses allowing the estimation of geoadditive models. Inference is fully Bayesian and uses recent MCMC techniques for drawing random samples from the posterior. In a couple of simulation studies the performance of Bayesian P-splines is studied and compared to other approaches in the literature. We illustrate the approach by two complex application on rents for flats in Munich and on human brain mapping.},

These interpretations also lead to flawed methods for applying background knowledge to model selection. We present a valid interpretation by showing how the distribution corresponding to a chain graph may be generated from the equilibrium distributions of dynamic models with feed-back. These dynamic interpretations lead to a simple theory of intervention, extending the theory developed for directed acyclic graphs. Finally, we contrast chain graph models under this interpretation with simultaneous equation models which have traditionally been used to model feed-back in econometrics.},

  abstract = {The understanding of the dynamics of animal populations and of related ecological and evolutionary issues frequently depends on a direct analysis of life history parameters. For instance, examination of trade\textemdash offs between reproduction and survival usually rely on individually marked animals, for which the exact time of death is most often unknown, because marked individuals cannot be followed closely through time. Thus, the quantitative analysis of survival studies and experiments must be based on capture\textemdash recapture (or resighting) models which consider, besides the parameters of primary interest, recapture or resighting rates that are nuisance parameters. Capture\textemdash recapture models oriented to estimation of survival rates are the result of a recent change in emphasis from earlier approaches in which population size was the most important parameter, survival rates having been first introduced as nuisance parameters. This emphasis on survival rates in capture\textemdash recapture models developed rapidly in the 1980s and used as a basic structure the Cormack\textemdash Jolly\textemdash Seber survival model applied to an homogeneous group of animals, with various kinds of constraints on the model parameters. These approaches are conditional on first captures; hence they do not attempt to model the initial capture of unmarked animals as functions of population abundance in addition to survival and capture probabilities. This paper synthesizes, using a common framework, these recent developments together with new ones, with an emphasis on flexibility in modeling, model selection, and the analysis of multiple data sets. The effects on survival and capture rates of time, age, and categorical variables characterizing the individuals (e.g., sex) can be considered, as well as interactions between such effects. This 'analysis of variance' philosophy emphasizes the structure of the survival and capture process rather than the technical characteristics of any particular model. The flexible array of models encompassed in this synthesis uses a common notation. As a result of the great level of flexibility and relevance achieved, the focus is changed from fitting a particular model to model building and model selection. The following procedure is recommended: (1) start from a global model compatible with the biology of the species studied and with the design of the study, and assess its fit; (2) select a more parsimonious model using Akaike's Information Criterion to limit the number of formal tests; (3) test for the most important biological questions by comparing this model with neighboring ones using likelihood ratio tests; and (4) obtain maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters with estimates of precision. Computer software is critical, as few of the models now available have parameter estimators that are in closed form. A comprehensive table of existing computer software is provided. We used RELEASE for data summary and goodness\textemdash of\textemdash fit tests and SURGE for iterative model fitting and the computation of likelihood ratio tests. Five increasingly complex examples are given to illustrate the theory. The first, using two data sets on the European Dipper (Cinclus cinclus), tests for sex\textemdash specific parameters, explores a model with time\textemdash dependent survival rates, and finally uses a priori information to model survival allowing for an environmental variable. The second uses data on two colonies of the Swift (Apus apus), and shows how interaction terms can be modeled and assessed and how survival and recapture rates sometimes partly counterbalance each other. The third shows complex variation in survival rates across sexes and age classes in the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), with a test of density dependence in annual survival rates. The fourth is an example of experimental density manipulation using the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). The last example attempts to examine a large and complex data set on the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber), where parameters are age specific, survival is a function of an environmental variable, and an age {$\times$} year interaction term is important. Heterogeneity seems present in this example and cannot be adequately modeled with existing theory. The discussion presents a summary of the paradigm we recommend and details issues in model selection and design, and foreseeable future developments.},

A joint estimation method that models several groups simultaneously can be more efficient than estimating parameters in each group separately. We focus on unraveling the dependence structures of data based on directed acyclic graphs and propose a Bayesian joint inference method for multiple graphs. To encourage similar dependence structures across all groups, a Markov random field prior is adopted. We establish the joint selection consistency of the fractional posterior in high dimensions, and benefits of the joint inference are shown under the common support assumption. This is the first Bayesian method for joint estimation of multiple directed acyclic graphs. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using simulation studies, and it is shown that our joint inference outperforms other competitors. We apply our method to an fMRI data for simultaneously inferring multiple brain functional networks.},

The health status process is assumed to be latent or unobservable. The time to reach the primary end point or failure (death, onset of disease, etc.) is the time when the latent health status process first crosses a failure threshold level. Inferences for the model are based on two kinds of data: censored survival data and marker measurements. Covariates, such as treatment variables, risk factors and base-line conditions, are related to the model parameters through generalized linear regression functions. The model offers a much richer potential for the study of treatment efficacy than do conventional models. Treatment effects can be assessed in terms of their influence on both the failure threshold and the health status process parameters. We derive an explicit formula for the prediction of residual failure times given the current marker level. Also we discuss model validation. This model does not require the proportional hazards assumption and hence can be widely used. To demonstrate the usefulness of the model, we apply the methods in analysing data from the protocol 116a of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group.},

First hitting times arise naturally in many types of stochastic processes, ranging from Wiener processes to Markov chains. In a survival context, the state of the underlying process represents the strength of an item or the health of an individual. The item fails or the individual experiences a clinical endpoint when the process reaches an adverse threshold state for the first time. The time scale can be calendar time or some other operatioal measure of degradation or disease progression. In many applications, the process is latent (i.e., unobservable). Threshold regression refers to first-hitting-time models with regression structures that accommodate covariate data. The parameters of the process, threshold state and time scale may depend on the covariates. This paper reviews aspects of this topic and discusses fruitful avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Time-to-event data with time-varying covariates pose an interesting challenge for statistical modeling and inference, especially where the data require a regression structure but are not consistent with the proportional hazard assumption. Threshold regression (TR) is a relatively new methodology based on the concept that degradation or deterioration of a subject's health follows a stochastic process and failure occurs when the process first reaches a failure state or threshold (a first-hitting-time). Survival data with time-varying covariates consist of sequential observations on the level of degradation and/or on covariates of the subject, prior to the occurrence of the failure event. Encounters with this type of data structure abound in practical settings for survival analysis and there is a pressing need for simple regression methods to handle the longitudinal aspect of the data. Using a Markov property to decompose a longitudinal record into a series of single records is one strategy for dealing with this type of data. This study looks at the theoretical conditions for which this Markov approach is valid. The approach is called threshold regression with Markov decomposition or Markov TR for short. A number of important special cases, such as data with unevenly spaced time points and competing risks as stopping modes, are discussed. We show that a proportional hazards regression model with time-varying covariates is consistent with the Markov TR model. The Markov TR procedure is illustrated by a case application to a study of lung cancer risk. The procedure is also shown to be consistent with the use of an alternative time scale. Finally, we present the connection of the procedure to the concept of a collapsible survival model. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2010 John Wiley {$\&$} Sons, Ltd.},

A central question in multimodal integrative analysis is to understand how two data modalities associate and interact with each other given another modality or demographic covariates. The problem can be formulated as studying the associations among three sets of random variables, a question that has received relatively less attention in the literature. In this article, we propose a novel generalized liquid association analysis method, which offers a new and unique angle to this important class of problem of studying three-way associations. We extend the notion of liquid association of Li (2002) from the univariate setting to the multivariate and high-dimensional setting. We establish a population dimension reduction model, transform the problem to sparse Tucker decomposition of a three-way tensor, and develop a higher-order singular value decomposition estimation algorithm. We derive the non-asymptotic error bound and asymptotic consistency of the proposed estimator, while allowing the variable dimensions to be larger than and diverge with the sample size. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method through both simulations and a multimodal neuroimaging application for Alzheimer's disease research.},

The proposed method is applicable to a broad class of probabilistic graphical models, including models with loops. Unlike a standard SMC sampler, the proposed divide-and-conquer SMC employs multiple independent populations of weighted particles, which are resampled, merged, and propagated as the method progresses. We illustrate empirically that this approach can outperform standard methods in terms of the accuracy of the posterior expectation and marginal likelihood approximations. Divide-and-conquer SMC also opens up novel parallel implementation options and the possibility of concentrating the computational effort on the most challenging subproblems. We demonstrate its performance on a Markov random field and on a hierarchical logistic regression problem.

For some devices, it is possible to obtain degradation measurements over time, and these measurements may contain useful information about product reliability. Even with little or no censoring, there may be important practical advantages to analyzing degradation data. If failure is defined in terms of a specified level of degradation, a degradation model defines a particular time-to-failure distribution. Generally it is not possible to obtain a closed-form expression for this distribution. The purpose of this work is to develop statistical methods for using degradation measures to estimate a time-to-failure distribution for a broad class of degradation models. We use a nonlinear mixed-effects model and develop methods based on Monte Carlo simulation to obtain point estimates and confidence intervals for reliability assessment.},

"Drug cocktail" treatments are often prescribed to improve the overall efficacy, decrease toxicity, alter pharmacodynamics, etc in an overall treatment strategy. Specifically, if when combined, drugs interact in some way that causes the total effect to be greater than that predicted by their individual potencies, then drugs are considered synergistic. While there are established ways to quantify the impact of drug combinations clinically, it is an open challenge to quantitatively summarize a synergistic interaction. In this paper, we discuss an overview of the current statistical and mathematical methods for the study of drug combination effects, especially drug synergy quantification (where the interaction effect is not just detected, but quantified according to its magnitude). We first introduce two popular reference models for testing to null hypothesis of non-interaction for a combination, including the Bliss independence model and the Loewe additivity model. Then we discuss several methods for quantifying drug synergism. The advantages and disadvantages with these methods are also provided, and finally, we discuss important next directions in this area.},

It may be easier to instead specify distinct submodels for each source of data, then join the submodels together. We consider chains of submodels, where submodels directly relate to their neighbours via common quantities which may be parameters or deterministic functions thereof. We propose chained Markov melding, an extension of Markov melding, a generic method to combine chains of submodels into a joint model. One challenge we address is appropriately capturing the prior dependence between common quantities within a submodel, whilst also reconciling differences in priors for the same common quantity between two adjacent submodels. Estimating the posterior of the resulting overall joint model is also challenging, so we describe a sampler that uses the chain structure to incorporate information contained in the submodels in multiple stages, possibly in parallel. We demonstrate our methodology using two examples. The first example considers an ecological integrated population model, where multiple data are required to accurately estimate population immigration and reproduction rates. We also consider a joint longitudinal and time-to-event model with uncertain, submodel-derived event times. Chained Markov melding is a conceptually appealing approach to integrating submodels in these settings.},

Several software packages are now also available for their implementation. Although mathematically straightforward, the inclusion of multiple longitudinal outcomes in the joint model remains computationally difficult due to the large number of random effects required, which hampers the practical application of this extension. We present a novel approach that enables the fitting of such models with more realistic computational times. The idea behind the approach is to split the estimation of the joint model in two steps: estimating a multivariate mixed model for the longitudinal outcomes and then using the output from this model to fit the survival submodel. So-called two-stage approaches have previously been proposed and shown to be biased. Our approach differs from the standard version, in that we additionally propose the application of a correction factor, adjusting the estimates obtained such that they more closely resemble those we would expect to find with the multivariate joint model. This correction is based on importance sampling ideas. Simulation studies show that this corrected two-stage approach works satisfactorily, eliminating the bias while maintaining substantial improvement in computational time, even in more difficult settings.},

Magder and Hughes (1997, American Journal of Epidemiology146, 195\textendash 203) showed that failure to adjust for imperfect outcome measures in logistic regression analysis can conservatively bias estimation of covariate effects, even when the mismeasurement rate is the same across levels of the covariate. Other authors have addressed the need to account for mismeasurement in survival analysis in selected cases (Snapinn, 1998, Biometrics54, 209\textendash 218; Gelfand and Wang, 2000, Statistics in Medicine19, 1865\textendash 1879; Balasubramanian and Lagakos, 2001, Biometrics57, 1048\textendash 1058, 2003, Biometrika90, 171\textendash 182). We provide a general, more widely applicable, adjusted proportional hazards (APH) method for estimation of cumulative survival and hazard ratios in discrete time when the outcome is measured with error. We show that mismeasured failure status in a standard proportional hazards (PH) model can conservatively bias estimation of hazard ratios and that inference, in most practical situations, is more severely affected by poor specificity than by poor sensitivity. However, in simulations over a wide range of conditions, the APH method with correctly specified mismeasurement rates performs very well.},

  abstract = {Oxygen saturation in the arterial blood (SaO2) provides information on the adequacy of respiratory function. SaO2 can be assessed noninvasively by pulse oximetry, which is based on photoplethysmographic pulses in two wavelengths, generally in the red and infrared regions. The calibration of the measured photoplethysmographic signals is performed empirically for each type of commercial pulse-oximeter sensor, utilizing in vitro measurement of SaO2 in extracted arterial blood by means of co-oximetry. Due to the discrepancy between the measurement of SaO2 by pulse oximetry and the invasive technique, the former is denoted as SpO2. Manufacturers of pulse oximeters generally claim an accuracy of 2{$\%$}, evaluated by the standard deviation (SD) of the differences between SpO2 and SaO2, measured simultaneously in healthy subjects. However, an SD of 2{$\%$} reflects an expected error of 4{$\%$} (two SDs) or more in 5{$\%$} of the examinations, which is in accordance with an error of 3{$\%$}\textendash 4{$\%$}, reported in clinical studies. This level of accuracy is sufficient for the detection of a significant decline in respiratory function in patients, and pulse oximetry has been accepted as a reliable technique for that purpose. The accuracy of SpO2 measurement is insufficient in several situations, such as critically ill patients receiving supplemental oxygen, and can be hazardous if it leads to elevated values of oxygen partial pressure in blood. In particular, preterm newborns are vulnerable to retinopathy of prematurity induced by high oxygen concentration in the blood. The low accuracy of SpO2 measurement in critically ill patients and newborns can be attributed to the empirical calibration process, which is performed on healthy volunteers. Other limitations of pulse oximetry include the presence of dyshemoglobins, which has been addressed by multiwavelength pulse oximetry, as well as low perfusion and motion artifacts that are partially rectified by sophisticated algorithms and also by reflection pulse oximetry.},

  abstract = {For time-to-event outcomes, a rich literature exists on the bias introduced by covariate measurement error in regression models, such as the Cox model, and methods of analysis to address this bias. By comparison, less attention has been given to understanding the impact or addressing errors in the failure time outcome. For many diseases, the timing of an event of interest (such as progression-free survival or time to AIDS progression) can be difficult to assess or reliant on self-report and therefore prone to measurement error. For linear models, it is well known that random errors in the outcome variable do not bias regression estimates. With non-linear models, however, even random error or misclassification can introduce bias into estimated parameters. We compare the performance of two common regression models, the Cox and Weibull models, in the setting of measurement error in the failure time outcome. We introduce an extension of the SIMEX method to correct for bias in hazard ratio estimates from the Cox model and discuss other analysis options to address measurement error in the response. A formula to estimate the bias induced into the hazard ratio by classical measurement error in the event time for a log-linear survival model is presented. Detailed numerical studies are presented to examine the performance of the proposed SIMEX method under varying levels and parametric forms of the error in the outcome. We further illustrate the method with observational data on HIV outcomes from the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic.},

  abstract = {Medical studies that depend on electronic health records (EHR) data are often subject to measurement error, as the data are not collected to support research questions under study. These data errors, if not accounted for in study analyses, can obscure or cause spurious associations between patient exposures and disease risk. Methodology to address covariate measurement error has been well developed; however, time-to-event error has also been shown to cause significant bias, but methods to address it are relatively underdeveloped. More generally, it is possible to observe errors in both the covariate and the time-to-event outcome that are correlated. We propose regression calibration (RC) estimators to simultaneously address correlated error in the covariates and the censored event time. Although RC can perform well in many settings with covariate measurement error, it is biased for nonlinear regression models, such as the Cox model. Thus, we additionally propose raking estimators which are consistent estimators of the parameter defined by the population estimating equation. Raking can improve upon RC in certain settings with failure-time data, require no explicit modeling of the error structure, and can be utilized under outcome-dependent sampling designs. We discuss features of the underlying estimation problem that affect the degree of improvement the raking estimator has over the RC approach. Detailed simulation studies are presented to examine the performance of the proposed estimators under varying levels of signal, error, and censoring. The methodology is illustrated on observational EHR data on HIV outcomes from the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic.},

However, in some practice settings, daily arterial blood gas data required to calculate the respiratory component of the SOFA score are often unavailable. The objectives of this study were to derive Spo2/Fio2 (SF) ratio correlations with the Pao2/Fio2 (PF) ratio to calculate the respiratory parameter of the SOFA score, and to validate the respiratory SOFA obtained using SF ratios against clinical outcomes.         Patients and Measurements:{$~$}         We obtained matched measurements of Spo2 and Pao2 from two populations: group 1\textemdash patients undergoing general anesthesia and group 2\textemdash patients from the acute respiratory distress syndrome network\textemdash low-vs. high-tidal volume for the acute respiratory management of acute respiratory distress syndrome database. Using a linear regression model, we first determined SF ratios corresponding to PF ratios of 100, 200, 300, and 400. Second, we evaluated the contribution of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the relationship between SF and PF, for patients on PEEP in centimeters of water (cm H2O) of {$<$}8, 8-12, and {$>$}12. Third, we calculated the SOFA scores in a separate cohort of intensive care unit patients using the derived SF ratios and validated them against clinical outcomes.         Results:{$~$}         The total SOFA scores calculated using SF ratios and PF ratios were highly correlated (Spearman's rho 0.85, p {$<$} 0.001) in all patients and in the three stratified PEEP categories ({$<$}8 cm H2O, Spearman's rho 0.87, p {$<$} 0.001; PEEP 8-12 cm H20, Spearman's rho 0.85, p {$<$} 0.001; PEEP {$>$}12 cm H2O, Spearman's rho 0.85, p {$<$} 0.001). The respiratory SOFA scores based on SF ratios and PF ratios correlated similarly with intensive care unit length of stay and ventilator-free days, when validated in a cohort of critically ill patients.

  abstract = {To combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic effectively, targeted interventions among certain key populations play a critical role. Examples of such key populations include sex workers, people who inject drugs, and men who have sex with men. While having accurate estimates for the size of these key populations is important, any attempt to directly contact or count members of these populations is difficult. As a result, indirect methods are used to produce size estimates. Multiple approaches for estimating the size of such populations have been suggested but often give conflicting results. It is therefore necessary to have a principled way to combine and reconcile these estimates. To this end, we present a Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating the size of key populations that combines multiple estimates from different sources of information. The proposed model makes use of multiple years of data and explicitly models the systematic error in the data sources used. We use the model to estimate the size of people who inject drugs in Ukraine. We evaluate the appropriateness of the model and compare the contribution of each data source to the final estimates.},

Specifically, we consider estimating the number of injection drug users in Ukraine by combining all available data sources spanning over half a decade and numerous sub-national areas in the Ukraine. This application is of interest to public health researchers as this hard to reach population that plays a large role in the spread of HIV.

Three methods are given to calculate confidence intervals based on the delta method, profile likelihood, and bootstrap, respectively.

However, some features of the Cox model may cause problems for the analyst or an interpreter of the data. They include the restrictive assumption of proportional hazards for covariate effects, and ``loss'' (non-estimation) of the baseline hazard function induced by conditioning on event times. In medicine, the hazard function is often of fundamental interest since it represents an important aspect of the time course of the disease in question. In the present article, the Stata implementation of a class of flexible parametric survival models recently proposed by Royston and Parmar (2001) will be described. The models start by assuming either proportional hazards or proportional odds (user-selected option). The baseline distribution function is modeled by restricted cubic regression spline in log time, and parameter estimation is by maximum likelihood. Model selection and choice of knots for the spline function are discussed. Interval-censored data and models in which one or more covariates have nonproportional effects are also supported by the software. Examples based on a study of prognostic factors in breast cancer are given.},

For example, non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events.

The belief of each expert is elicited as a multivariate prior distribution. Then, linear and logarithmic combination methods are used to represent a consensus distribution. Anyway, the choice of the appropriate strategy will depend on the decision maker's judgements. A significant task when using opinion pooling is to find the optimal weights. In order to carry it out, a criterion based on Kullback-Leibler divergence is proposed. Furthermore, based on the previous idea, an alternative procedure is presented when a solution cannot be found. The theoretical foundations are discussed in detail for each aggregation scheme. In particular, it is shown that a general unified method is achieved when they are applied to multivariate natural exponential families. Finally, two illustrative examples show that the proposed techniques can be easily applied in practice and their usefulness for decision making under the described situations.},

  abstract = {An important issue involved in group decision making is the suitable aggregation of experts' beliefs about a parameter of interest. Two widely used combination methods are linear and log-linear pools. Yet, a problem arises when the weights have to be selected. This paper provides a general decision-based procedure to obtain the weights in a log-linear pooled prior distribution. The process is based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is used as a calibration tool. No information about the parameter of interest is considered before dealing with the experts' beliefs. Then, a pooled prior distribution is achieved, for which the expected calibration is the best one in the Kullback-Leibler sense. In the absence of other information available to the decision-maker prior to getting experimental data, the methodology generally leads to selection of the most diffuse pooled prior. In most cases, a problem arises from the marginal distribution related to the noninformative prior distribution since it is improper. In these cases, an alternative procedure is proposed. Finally, two applications show how the proposed techniques can be easily applied in practice.},

It has previously been shown that restricted cubic splines can be used to approximate complex hazard functions in the context of time-to-event data. The degree of complexity for the spline functions is dictated by the number of knots that are defined. We highlight through the use of a motivating example that complex hazard function shapes are often required when analysing time-to-event data. Through the use of simulation, we show that provided a sufficient number of knots are used, the approximated hazard functions given by restricted cubic splines fit closely to the true function for a range of complex hazard shapes. The simulation results also highlight the insensitivity of the estimated relative effects (hazard ratios) to the correct specification of the baseline hazard.},

  abstract = {The understanding of how variation of demographic rates translates into variation of population growth is a central aim in population ecology. Besides stochastic and deterministic factors, the spatial extent and the isolation of a local population may have an impact on the contribution of the different demographic components. Using long-term demographic data we performed retrospective population analyses of four little owl (Athene noctua) populations with differential spatial extent and degree of isolation to assess the contribution of demographic rates to the variation of the growth rate ({$\lambda$}) of each local population and to the difference of {$\lambda$} among populations. In all populations variation of fecundity contributed least to variation of {$\lambda$}, and variation of adult survival contributed most to variation of {$\lambda$} in three of four populations. Between population comparisons revealed that differences mainly stem from differences of immigration and juvenile local survival. The relative importance of immigration to {$\lambda$} tended to decrease with increasing spatial extent and isolation of the local populations. None of the four local populations was self-sustainable. Because the local populations export and import individuals, they can be considered as open recruitment systems in which part of the recruited breeding birds are not produced locally. The spatial extent and the degree of isolation of a local population have an impact on local population dynamics; hence these factors need to be considered in studies about local population dynamics and for deriving conservation measures.},

We propose a semiparametric Bayesian methodology for this purpose, modeling both the unknown baseline hazard and density of the random effects using mixtures of B-splines. The posterior distributions for all regression coefficients and spline parameters are obtained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The methodology permits the use of weighted mixtures of parametric and nonparametric components in modeling the hazard function and frailty distribution; in addition, the spline knots may also be selected adaptively using reversible-jump MCMC. Simulations indicate that the method produces smooth and accurate posterior hazard and frailty density estimates. The Bayesian approach not only produces point estimators that outperform existing approaches in certain circumstances, but also offers a wealth of information about the parameters of interest in the form of MCMC samples from the joint posterior probability distribution. We illustrate the adaptability of the method with data from a study of congestive heart failure.},

Typically, a specific threshold/cut-off of the biomarker is chosen, values below which are indicative of recent infections. Such biomarkers have attracted considerable interest as the basis for incidence estimation using a cross-sectional sample. An estimate of HIV incidence can be obtained from the prevalence of recent infection, as measured in the sample, and knowledge of the time spent in the recent infection state, known as the window period. However, such calculations are based on a number of assumptions concerning the distribution of the window period. We compare two statistical methods for estimating the mean and distribution of a window period using data on repeated measurements of an antibody biomarker from a cohort of HIV seroconverters. The methods account for the interval-censored nature of both the date of seroconversion and the date of crossing a specific threshold. We illustrate the methods using repeated measurements of the Avidity Index (AI) and make recommendations about the choice of threshold for this biomarker so that the resulting window period satisfies the assumptions for incidence estimation.

  abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, genetic disease characterized by frequent, prolonged drops in lung function. Accurately predicting rapid underlying lung-function decline is essential for clinical decision support and timely intervention. Determining whether an individual is experiencing a period of rapid decline is complicated due to its heterogeneous timing and extent, and error component of the measured lung function. We construct individualized predictive probabilities for ``nowcasting'' rapid decline. We assume each patient's true longitudinal lung function, S(t), follows a nonlinear, nonstationary stochastic process, and accommodate between-patient heterogeneity through random effects. Corresponding lung-function decline at time t is defined as the rate of change, S{${'}$}(t). We predict S{${'}$}(t) conditional on observed covariate and measurement history by modeling a measured lung function as a noisy version of S(t). The method is applied to data on 30 879 US CF Registry patients. Results are contrasted with a currently employed decision rule using single-center data on 212 individuals. Rapid decline is identified earlier using predictive probabilities than the center's currently employed decision rule (mean difference: 0.65 years; 95{$\%$} confidence interval (CI): 0.41, 0.89). We constructed a bootstrapping algorithm to obtain CIs for predictive probabilities. We illustrate real-time implementation with R Shiny. Predictive accuracy is investigated using empirical simulations, which suggest this approach more accurately detects peak decline, compared with a uniform threshold of rapid decline. Median area under the ROC curve estimates (Q1-Q3) were 0.817 (0.814-0.822) and 0.745 (0.741-0.747), respectively, implying reasonable accuracy for both. This article demonstrates how individualized rate of change estimates can be coupled with probabilistic predictive inference and implementation for a useful medical-monitoring approach.},

Using a consensus process, a panel of experts convened in 2011 (an initiative of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine) developed the Berlin Definition, focusing on feasibility, reliability, validity, and objective evaluation of its performance. A draft definition proposed 3 mutually exclusive categories of ARDS based on degree of hypoxemia: mild (200 mm Hg{$~\&$}lt;{$~$}PaO2/FIO2{$~\leq~$}300 mm Hg), moderate (100 mm Hg{$~\&$}lt;{$~$}PaO2/FIO2{$~\leq~$}200 mm Hg), and severe (PaO2/FIO2{$~\leq~$}100 mm Hg) and 4 ancillary variables for severe ARDS: radiographic severity, respiratory system compliance ({$\leq$}40 mL/cm H2O), positive end-expiratory pressure ({$\geq$}10 cm H2O), and corrected expired volume per minute ({$\geq$}10 L/min). The draft Berlin Definition was empirically evaluated using patient-level meta-analysis of 4188 patients with ARDS from 4 multicenter clinical data sets and 269 patients with ARDS from 3 single-center data sets containing physiologic information. The 4 ancillary variables did not contribute to the predictive validity of severe ARDS for mortality and were removed from the definition. Using the Berlin Definition, stages of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS were associated with increased mortality (27{$\%$}; 95{$\%$} CI, 24{$\%$}-30{$\%$}; 32{$\%$}; 95{$\%$} CI, 29{$\%$}-34{$\%$}; and 45{$\%$}; 95{$\%$} CI, 42{$\%$}-48{$\%$}, respectively; P{$~\&$}lt;{$~$}.001) and increased median duration of mechanical ventilation in survivors (5 days; interquartile [IQR], 2-11; 7 days; IQR, 4-14; and 9 days; IQR, 5-17, respectively; P{$~\&$}lt;{$~$}.001). Compared with the AECC definition, the final Berlin Definition had better predictive validity for mortality, with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.577 (95{$\%$} CI, 0.561-0.593) vs 0.536 (95{$\%$} CI, 0.520-0.553; P{$~\&$}lt;{$~$}.001). This updated and revised Berlin Definition for ARDS addresses a number of the limitations of the AECC definition. The approach of combining consensus discussions with empirical evaluation may serve as a model to create more accurate, evidence-based, critical illness syndrome definitions and to better inform clinical care, research, and health services planning.},

Motivated by a suicide risk study, we propose an approach for analyzing survival data with uncertain event times arising from data integration. Specifically, in our problem deaths identified from the hospital discharge records together with reported suicidal deaths determined by the Office of Medical Examiner may still not include all the death events of patients, and the missing deaths can be recovered from a complete database of death records. Since the hospital discharge data can only be linked to the death record data by matching basic patient characteristics, a patient with a censored death time from the first dataset could be linked to multiple potential event records in the second dataset. We develop an integrative Cox proportional hazards regression in which the uncertainty in the matched event times is modeled probabilistically. The estimation procedure combines the ideas of profile likelihood and the expectation conditional maximization algorithm (ECM). Simulation studies demonstrate that under realistic settings of imperfect data linkage the proposed method outperforms several competing approaches including multiple imputation. A marginal screening analysis using the proposed integrative Cox model is performed to identify risk factors associated with death following suicide-related hospitalization in Connecticut. The identified diagnostics codes are consistent with existing literature and provide several new insights on suicide risk, prediction and prevention.},

Functions for constructing spline basis functions are available in R through the base package splines. When the curves to be modeled have known characteristics in monotonicity or curvature, more efficient statistical inferences are possible with shape-restricted splines. Such splines, however, are not available in the R package splines. The package splines2 provides easy-to-use shape-restricted spline basis functions, along with their derivatives and integrals which are important tools in many inference scenarios. It also provides additional splines and features that are not available in the splines package, such as periodic splines and generalized Bernstein polynomials. The usages of the functions are illustrated with shape-restricted regression, recurrent event data analysis, and extreme-value copulas.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the pressing need for suicide prevention through improving behavioral healthcare, we use medical claims data to study the risk of subsequent suicide attempts for patients who were hospitalized due to suicide attempts and later discharged. Understanding the risk behaviors of such patients at elevated suicide risk is an important step towards the goal of "Zero Suicide". An immediate and unconventional challenge is that the identification of suicide attempts from medical claims contains substantial uncertainty: almost 20{$\backslash\%$} of "suspected" suicide attempts are identified from diagnostic codes indicating external causes of injury and poisoning with undermined intent. It is thus of great interest to learn which of these undetermined events are more likely actual suicide attempts and how to properly utilize them in survival analysis with severe censoring. To tackle these interrelated problems, we develop an integrative Cox cure model with regularization to perform survival regression with uncertain events and a latent cure fraction. We apply the proposed approach to study the risk of subsequent suicide attempt after suicide-related hospitalization for adolescent and young adult population, using medical claims data from Connecticut. The identified risk factors are highly interpretable; more intriguingly, our method distinguishes the risk factors that are most helpful in assessing either susceptibility or timing of subsequent attempt. The predicted statuses of the uncertain attempts are further investigated, leading to several new insights on suicide event identification.},

  abstract = {In this article we investigate regression calibration methods to jointly model longitudinal and survival data using a semiparametric longitudinal model and a proportional hazards model. In the longitudinal model, a biomarker is assumed to follow a semiparametric mixed model where covariate effects are modeled parametrically and subject-specific time profiles are modeled nonparametrially using a population smoothing spline and subject-specific random stochastic processes. The Cox model is assumed for survival data by including both the current measure and the rate of change of the underlying longitudinal trajectories as covariates, as motivated by a prostate cancer study application. We develop a two-stage semiparametric regression calibration (RC) method. Two variations of the RC method are considered, risk set regression calibration and a computationally simpler ordinary regression calibration. Simulation results show that the two-stage RC approach performs well in practice and effectively corrects the bias from the naive method. We apply the proposed methods to the analysis of a dataset for evaluating the effects of the longitudinal biomarker PSA on the recurrence of prostate cancer.},

  abstract = {Time-to-event analysis of sexually transmitted infection data is often complicated by the existence of nonproportional hazards and nonlinear independent variable effects. Methods without the proportional hazards assumption, such as threshold regression models, have been successfully used in many applications. This paper seeks to extend the existing threshold regression models to accommodate the nonlinear independent variable effects. Specifically, we incorporated penalized and regression splines to the threshold regression models for added modeling flexibility. Cross validation methods were used for the selection of the number of knots and for the determination of smoothing parameters. Variance estimates were proposed for inference purposes. Simulation results showed that the proposed methods were able to achieve nonparametric function and parametric coefficient estimates that are close to their true values. Simulation also demonstrated satisfactory performance of variance estimates. Using the proposed methods, we analyzed time from sexual debut to the first infection with Chlamydia trachomatis infection in a group of young women. Analysis shows that the lifetime number of sexual partners has a nonlinear effect on the risk of C. trachomatis infection and the infection risks were differential by ethnicity and age of sexual debut.

  abstract = {Assessing the impacts of ongoing climate and anthropogenic-induced change on wildlife populations requires understanding species distributions and abundances across large spatial and temporal scales. For threatened or declining populations, collecting sufficient broad-scale data is challenging as sample sizes tend to be low because many such species are rare and/or elusive. As a result, demographic data are often piecemeal, leading to difficulties in determining causes of population changes and developing strategies to mitigate the effects of environmental stressors. Thus, the population dynamics of threatened species across spatio-temporal extents is typically inferred through incomplete, independent, local-scale studies. Emerging integrative modeling approaches, such as integrated population models (IPMs), combine multiple data types into a single analysis and provide a foundation for overcoming problems of sparse or fragmentary data. In this paper, we demonstrate how IPMs can be successfully implemented by synthesizing the elements, advantages, and novel insights of this modeling approach. We highlight the latest developments in IPMs that are explicitly relevant to the ecology and conservation of threatened species, including capabilities to quantify the spatial scale of management, sourcesink dynamics, synchrony within metapopulations, and population density effects on demographic rates. Adoption of IPMs has led to improved detection of population declines, adaptation of targeted monitoring schemes, and refined management strategies. Continued methodological advancements of IPMs, such as incorporation of a wider set of data types (e.g., citizen science data) and coupled population-environment models, will allow for broader applicability within ecological and conservation sciences.},
