I really appreciated the authors' detailed response document.
For the record, I still think the manuscript is too long and the second example is too complicated for readers to easily digest.
It seems like the second reviewer agreed with me on that.
With that said, I understand the authors' reason for retaining it in the main text and they did add some clarifying comments and background about the approach that were helpful.
There are still a few remaining details that are fuzzy, for example on page 23, first paragraph of section 5.5, "we fit appropriate parametric mixture distributions to the unknown prior marginal distributions."
However, I understand there are a lot of choices and complexities to these approaches when different priors are used for submodels, and they clearly described the challenges associated with that in their author response document.
Also, regarding the complicated second example in the manuscript: It seems unreasonable to ask them to prepare an entirely new example that is slightly simpler.
Finally, they have a couple of really similar papers that have been published recently; one just appeared in Statistics and Computing (Manderson and Goudie, 2022) and while they did cite it, it's not really clear how these two papers are different.
