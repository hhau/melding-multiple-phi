\begin{quote}
\emph{My main suggestion is for the authors to shorten the manuscript by
moving one of the examples to an appendix and instead add a bit more
detail about how the melding actually works for readers who may not have
familiarity with the previous literature on the topic (including the
authors' prior paper on it). I appreciate both examples in the
manuscript, but it might be better to include details about when the
pooling results in inference that is exact versus approximate, for
example. There are many choices one must make to implement these methods
for fitting models and I think it would help to provide some additional
details about the approximation that occurs and the actual algorithms
that are used (multi-stage) to fit the models using this approach which
don't currently appear until the appendix.}
\end{quote}

We thank the reviewer for the kind comments. We will respond in reverse
order to the comments raised by Reviewer 1.

We agree that there are many choices to make when implementing chained
Markov melding, but we delineate between choices specific to chained
Markov melding and those that must be made in fitting any model. We wish
to include in the main text the choices that we feel will \emph{always}
be relevant to applications of chained Markov melding, with important,
but ultimately example-specific, choices included in the appendix. To
this point, we have clarified the the purposes of the appendices in the
text, and have hopefully assured the reviewer that material in the
appendices is overly specific to our second example. Our changes
include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Clarifying in the main text that Appendix B is provided only for
  completeness. We do not use the sequential sampler in either of our
  examples.
\item
  Emphasising in the text and within the appendix that Appendix K is
  only possible due to the conditional independence between individuals
  in the posterior, which is very specific to the models under
  consideration in the second example.
\end{enumerate}

Furthermore, we think that Appendices E, G, and H, which cover prior
specification and prior marginal estimation, are important but
ultimately routine aspects of Bayesian modelling. Specifying appropriate
priors is a universal task when using the Bayesian paradigm, and
performing density estimation from Monte Carlo samples should be
familiar to most statistical practitioners. We have also introduced a
more sophisticated methodology for density estimation in this setting in
Manderson and Goudie
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-manderson_numerically_2022}{2022}) for the
particularly interested reader. Appendices D and I are decisions
specific to the data we consider, which is more specific than the
models, and would be made as part of any analysis of observational data
(and would often go unreported), or would be specified in an analysis
plan.

We are unsure of the meaning of the comment describing pooling as
producing inference that is exact or approximate. When all prior
marginal densities are known analytically, the pooling function produces
an analytic expression proportional to
\(\pd_{\text{pool}}(\boldsymbol{\phi})\) -- there is no approximation
error here. If one or more of the prior marginal densities is unknown,
then we suggest approximating it (or a transformation of it) with a
standard distribution, or using kernel density estimation. Regardless,
the pooling function does not introduce any approximation in addition to
that of the prior marginal density estimate.

To address Reviewer 1's first comment, we appreciate (and agree with)
the inclination towards a shorter manuscript, but ultimately feel tied
to including both examples in the main text. As Reviewer 2 notes, the
first example is intentionally illustrative -- we have split an existing
joint model to illustrate, in a simpler setting, the melding steps and
computational tools whilst possessing a baseline set of result for
comparison. This example is also intended to reassure the reader that
our proposed multi-stage sampler can produce accurate results. Whilst we
find this example informative, it is ultimately insufficiently
compelling to justify the methodology. Example 2 is much more compelling
for the methodology, and as Reviewer 2 notes it is this complexity that
is ultimately the motivating aspect of the methodology. Without such
complex submodels we might be able to directly conceive of a joint model
for all sources of data. Without the second example we feel some readers
will be left wondering what use, if any, there might be for our method.
Finally, cutting the first example would save only 4 pages, so
information currently in the appendix would remain there in either case.

We hope that these points, in addition to addressing the reviewers other
comments, sufficiently convince the reviewer of the need for both
examples.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We thank the reviewer for the kind comments.

\begin{quote}
\emph{(2) I would like the authors to explain why one would not simply
ensure that all sub-models can use the same prior, so that we are back
in the ``Markov combination'' setting of Equation 1 (in which case no
``pooled'' priors need to be constructed). It seems to me that a
principled Bayesian approach would always seek to formulate a single
prior distribution over all parameters in the model.}
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We agree in principle with this sentiment -- it seems desirable to
  have the same prior for the same quantity in different models.
\item
  But there is a tension between having the individual submodels be
  complete and contained, meaning that they could be produced
  independently of the submodels, and having the same prior for all
  common quantities under all submodels.
\item
  Perhaps our biggest struggle with this idea is visible in example two,
  where the common quantity \(\phi_{1 \cap 2}\) is the response in the
  second submodel
  \(\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{2}, Y_{2})\) and
  \(\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})\) contains dependence
  between the common quantities.
\item
  There are two approaches to ensuring
  \(\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}) = \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})\),
  \(\pd_{2}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}) = \pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3})\), and
  \(\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})\pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}) = \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})\)
  in example two.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Carefully and simultaneously select the prior for the spline
    coefficients in \(\pd_{1}\) and the prior for the piecewise-linear
    regression parameters in \(\pd_{3}\), such that all the
    aforementioned equalities are satisfied.
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    There are no guarantees that such a set of priors exists\footnote{In
      our experience there are typically many possible priors that have
      a specific prior predictive distribution for a quantity that is a
      non-invertible transformation of the parameters. Locating them
      requires both specialised methodology and a decision analysis to
      choose between the possible priors.}, and even if they did it's
    unclear how we might actually specify them.
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Externally define \(\pd_{\text{pool}}(\boldsymbol{\phi})\) and
    replace \(\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})\) with
    \(\pd_{\text{pool}}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})\),
    \(\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})\) with
    \(\pd_{\text{pool}}(\boldsymbol{\phi})\), and
    \(\pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3})\) with
    \(\pd_{\text{pool}}(\phi_{2 \cap 3})\). Alternatively we could
    expand \(\pd_{1}\) to be aware of \(\pd_{3}\) by replacing
    \(\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})\) with
    \(\pd_{\text{pool}}(\boldsymbol{\phi})\), doing likewise for
    \(\pd_{3}\).
  \end{enumerate}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Both proposals require some kind of pooling to account for applying
    the prior twice when combining the submodels, should the user wish
    to correct for this information.
  \item
    The second proposal requires expanding the first and third submodels
    to include a quantity unrelated to the submodel or the submodel's
    data. There is no information about e.g.~\(\phi_{2 \cap 3}\) in
    \(\pd_{1}\). This submodel expansion makes it more difficult to
    understand the submodels in isolation.
  \item
    One aim of our methodology is to enable the construction of complex
    joint models by combining smaller, easier to understand submodels.
    The ability to specify, and possibly fit and interrogate a submodel
    before combining it is key -- we'd like to understand the submodels
    themselves before combining them. In particular, either proposal
    yields a very strange model for \(\pd_{2}\), which would contain an
    prior distribution directly on the observational quantity in
    addition to the likelihood (as well as the prior on the other
    parameters). Whilst many of these properties are also true of the
    chained melded model, the key difference is that the submodels
    remain unmodified and are understandable in isolation.
  \item
    There are no guarantees that a prior that ``works'' (appropriately
    represents known information and facilitates the computation of the
    subposterior) for the submodel will be suitable for the chained
    melded model with its higher dimensional parameter space. Pooling
    allows us to take known priors and modify them in a transparent way
    to ensure they are suitable for the larger chained melded model.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
\emph{(3) The proposed methodology appears to perform well in the
integrated-population-model (IPM) example. But, as the authors mention,
this is just for illustration since the joint posterior distribution in
this model can be easily and cheaply approximated using a single MCMC
chain via standard software packages.} \emph{The model in Section 5
appears to be realistically complex. It is great to see such non-toy
examples in a methodological paper. However, the example is almost too
complex: I am finding it difficult to understand how well (or poorly)
the proposed methodology performs here. It would be really good to have
benchmark results for the joint model without the bias induced by Markov
melding (i.e.~in the same way as these are shown for the IPM example). I
would expect that such results are be attainable using a sequential
Monte Carlo sampler.}
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We find find the meaning of the word `bias' difficult to determine in
  this comment. Does it refer to the hypothetical `bias' introduced by
  the chained Markov melding process (which produces a joint model), or
  the bias introduced by the computational multi-stage algorithm we
  propose to sample the chained melded posterior?
\item
  Chained Markov melding does not necessarily introduce any `bias'. As
  noted in the text for the first example, the IPM and the log-pooling
  with \(\lambda = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})\) are
  precisely the same joint model, so no possible `bias' has been
  introduced by chained Markov melding in that example.
\item
  If it is this type of bias the reviewer has in mind, then the question
  is what joint model the reviewer wishes to target? The product of the
  individual submodels is already a form of chained Markov melding (with
  product-of-experts pooling), and thus would likewise possess any
  possible `bias' present in the PoE case presented in Section 5.6.
\item
  Additionally, in the PoE case, there is no bias due to marginal
  density approximation as these terms all cancel in the second stage
  acceptance probability (so we do not use the marginal approximations).
\item
  If it is the bias in the multi-stage algorithm then:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Any finite sample, finite time approximation method will posses some
    form of bias.
  \item
    The joint model parameter space is quite high dimensional (648). The
    HMC within Stan is key to getting reliable posterior samples from
    the first and third subposteriors.
  \item
    The proposed multi-stage parallel sampler is a crude SMC sampler
    (with no particle refreshment step and an immediate tempering
    schedule).
  \item
    there genuinely are no generic tools for sampling the joint (melded)
    model in one step (Stan and a TMB-based/\texttt{RcppSmc} SMC
    (\protect\hyperlink{ref-eddelbuettel_rcppsmc_2021}{Eddelbuettel
    \emph{et al.}, 2021};
    \protect\hyperlink{ref-johansen_smctc_2009}{Johansen, 2009}) lack
    access to a multiple root finder, as does the BUGS language (in
    addition to its insufficient flexibility) rendering the SMC inside
    \texttt{Nimble}
    (\protect\hyperlink{ref-michaud_sequential_2020}{Michaud \emph{et
    al.}, 2020}) unsuitable).

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      We'd have to build it ourselves, and I'm not convinced I could
      code one that would converge.
    \item
      Any SMC sampler I would build would simply sample
      \(\pd_{1}(\theta_{1} \mid Y_{1})\) and
      \(\pd_{3}(\theta_{3} \mid Y_{3})\) first using Stan/HMC, then
      temper in the chained melded posterior as a target. Determining
      refreshment moves for the \(370\) spline coefficients would
      probably require a sufficiently novel SMC+HMC refreshment scheme
      that I would also want to include it in Section 3.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Computing the event times and indicators is not entirely trivial
    computationally. Embedding this inside an SMC sampler is expensive
    (it is prohibitively expensive for HMC as we need to autodiff
    through a loop over a root-finder, which in turn repeatedly calls
    the b-spline basis function). Computing the event times as a
    processing step after stage one but before stage tow makes this step
    embarrassingly parallel (making the multistage sampler feasible).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
\emph{(4) If benchmark results cannot be obtained for the model from
Section 5, this would also be interesting and mentioning this would make
the paper much stronger. Because when reading the paper, I did not see
an explanation of why the model could not be estimated without Markov
melding (and without the bias that this can introduce).}
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This comment again makes us ask the question about what target or
  joint model the reviewer has in mind.
