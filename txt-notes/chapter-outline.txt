# Chapter / paper outline

## Introduction

- Why multi source
  - usual motivating reasons

- Examples in Ecology

- Examples in ?

- What are the problems encountered here

- Why is this valuable / why is encompassing it in the Melding framework useful?
  - Unifying things into a common, general framework?
    - IPMs are already a 'common framework' for ecologists?
  - Multi-stage sampling can be a good option? (need to demonstrate)
    - I personally believe sampling the joint with HMC wherever possible is the best thing to do.
      - maybe Melding lets us use a good proposal for the discrete part of the parameter space, and then HMC for the continuous part?
  - if it works: advantage over the SMC idea is that earlier likelihoods don't have to be re-evaluated, down side: might work less often.

## Methods

- Specification

- Estimation
  - Pooled prior estimation
  - Sequential vs parallel estimation
  - exploiting properties of the model relationship structure

- software for doing this?
  - yeah look who knows, I should implement some examples in a naive way and look for the similarities?

## Examples

- example 1 - ecology
  - Why why why is this valuable in a melding framework
    - Maybe I can do some of it in parallel? Is that where the advantage is? That doesn't _feel_ melding specific, but maybe the framework makes it more obvious where opportunities for parallelism lie?

- example 2 - ??
  - Let's talk to Anne

- example 3 - ?? Let's find another field?
