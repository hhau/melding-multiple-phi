  A challenge for practitioners of Bayesian inference is specifying a model that incorporates multiple relevant, heterogeneous data.
  It may be easier to instead specify distinct submodels for each source of data, then join the submodels together.
  We consider chains of submodels, where submodels directly relate to their neighbours via common quantities which may be parameters or deterministic functions thereof.
  We propose _chained Markov melding_, an extension of Markov melding, to combine chains of submodels into a joint model.
  Estimating the posterior of the resulting overall joint model is challenging, so we describe a sampler that uses the chain structure to incorporate information contained in the submodels in multiple stages, possibly in parallel.
  We demonstrate our methodology using two examples.
  The first example considers an ecological integrated population model, where multiple data are required to accurately estimate population immigration and reproduction rates.
  We also consider a joint longitudinal and time-to-event model with uncertain, submodel-derived event times.
  Chained Markov melding is a conceptually appealing approach to integrating submodels in these settings.

# Introduction

The Bayesian philosophy is appealing in part because the posterior distribution quantifies all sources of uncertainty.
However, a joint model for all data and parameters is a prerequisite to posterior inference, and in situations where multiple, heterogeneous sources of data are available, specifying such a joint model is a formidable task.
Models that consider such data are necessary to describe complex phenomena at a useful precision.
One possible approach begins by specifying individual submodels for each source of data.
These submodels could guide the statistician when directly specifying the joint model, but to use the submodels only informally seems wasteful.
Instead, it may be preferable to construct a joint model by formally joining the individual submodels together.

Some specific forms of combining data are well established.
Meta-analyses and evidence synthesis methods are widely used to summarise data, often using hierarchical models [@ades_multiparameter_2006; @presanis_synthesising_2014].
Outside of the statistical literature, a common name for combining multiple data is _data fusion_ [@lahat_multimodal_2015-1; @kedem_statistical_2017], though there are many distinct methods that fall under this general name.
Interest in integrating data is not just methodological; applied researchers often collect multiple disparate data sets, or data of different modalities, and wish to combine them.
For example, to estimate SARS-CoV-2 positivity @donnat_bayesian_2020 build an intricate hierarchical model that integrates both testing data and self-reported questionnaire data, and @parsons_bayesian_2021 specify a hierarchical model of similar complexity to estimate the number of injecting drug users in Ukraine.
Both applications specify Bayesian models with data-specific components, which are united in a hierarchical manner.
In conservation ecology, _integrated population models_ (IPMs) [@zipkin_synthesizing_2018] are used to estimate population dynamics, e.g. reproduction and immigration rates, using multiple data on the same population.
Such data have standard models associated with them, such as the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model [@lebreton_modeling_1992] for capture-recapture data, and the IPM serves as the framework in which the standard models are combined.
More generally, the applications we list illustrate the importance of generic, flexible methods for combining data to applied researchers.

_Markov melding_ [@goudie_joining_2019] is a general statistical methodology for combining submodels.
Specifically, it considers $\Nm$ submodels that share some common quantity $\phi$, with each of the $\modelindex = 1, \ldots, \Nm$ submodels possessing distinct parameters $\psi_{\modelindex}$, data $Y_{\modelindex}$, and form $\pd_{\modelindex}(\phi, \psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex})$.
@goudie_joining_2019 then propose to combine the submodels into a joint model, denoted  $\pd_{\text{meld}}(\phi, \psi_{1}, \ldots, \psi_{\Nm}, Y_{1}, \ldots, Y_{\Nm})$.
However, it is unclear how to integrate models where there is no single quantity $\phi$ common to all submodels, such as for submodels that are linked in a chain structure.

We propose an extension to Markov melding, which we call _chained Markov melding_[^chained], which facilitates the combination of submodels that are in a chain structure.
Specifically, in the $\Nm = 3$ case, we address the case in which submodel 1 and 2 share a common quantity $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$, and submodel 2 and 3 share a different quantity $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$.
Two examples serve to illustrate our methodology, which we introduce in the following section.
The computational effort required to fit a complex, multi-response model is a burden to the model development process.
We propose a multi-stage posterior estimation method that exploits the properties of our chained melded model to reduce this burden.
We can parallelise aspects of the computation across the submodels, using less computationally expensive techniques for some submodels.
Reusing existing software implementations of submodels, and where available subposterior samples, is also possible.
Multi-stage samplers can aid in understanding the contribution of each submodel to the final posterior, and are used in many applied settings, including hierarchical modelling [@lunn:etal:13] and joint models [@mauff_joint_2020].

[^chained]: _"Chained graphs"_ were considered by @lauritzen_chain_2002, however they are unrelated to our proposed model. We use "chained" to emphasise the nature of the relationships between submodels.

## Example introduction

In this section we provide a high-level overview of two applications that require integrating a chain of submodels.
We will provide more details and illustrate our methodology with these examples in Section \ref{examples}.

### An Integrated population model for little owls {-}

Integrated population models (IPMs) [@zipkin_synthesizing_2018] combine multiple data to estimate key quantities governing the dynamics of a specific population.
@schaub_local_2006 and @abadi_estimation_2010 used an IPM to estimate fecundity, immigration, and yearly survival rates for a population of little owls.
These authors collect and model three types of data, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:owls-simple-dag}.
Capture-recapture data $Y_{1}$, and associated capture-recapture submodel $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \psi_{1}, Y_{1})$, are acquired by capturing and tagging owls each year, and then counting the number of tagged individuals recaptured in subsequent years.
Population counts $Y_{2}$ are obtained by observing the number of occupied nesting sites, and are modelled in $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{2}, Y_{2})$.
Finally, nest-record data $Y_{3}$ counts both the number of reproductive successes and possible breading pairs, and is associated with a submodel for fecundity $\pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{3}, Y_{3})$.
The population count model $\pd_{2}$ shares the parameter $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ with the capture-recapture model $\pd_{1}$, and the parameter $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$ with the fecundity model $\pd_{3}$.
No single source of data is sufficient to estimate all quantities of interest, so it is necessary to integrate the three submodels into a single joint model to produce acceptably precise estimates of fecundity and immigration rates.
We will show that the chained Markov melding framework developed in Section \ref{chained-model-specification} encapsulates the process of integrating these submodels, and IPMs in general.

\input{tex-input/owls-example/0001-owls-simple-dag.tex}

### Survival analysis with time varying covariates and uncertain event times {-}

Our second example considers the time to onset of respiratory failure (RF) amongst patients in intensive care units, and factors that influence the onset of RF.
A patient can be said to be experiencing RF if the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial blood oxygen (\paoii) to the faction of inspired oxygen (\fioii) is less than 300mmHg [@the_ards_definition_task_force_acute_2012], though this is not the only definition of RF.
Drawing arterial blood is a painful procedure, and calculating \paoii\ requires laboratory testing, so patients' \pfratio\ (P/F) ratios are not always available.
The relatively infrequency of P/F ratio data, when combined with the intrinsic variability in each individual's blood oxygen level, results in significant uncertainty in about the time of onset of RF.

Factors that influence the time to onset of RF are both longitudinal and time invariant.
Both types of data can be considered in _joint models_ [@rizopoulos_joint_2012], which are composed of two distinct submodels, one for each data type.
Failing to incorporate the uncertainty surrounding the event time may result overconfident and/or biased estimates of the parameters in the joint model.

Chained Markov melding offers a conceptually straightforward, Bayesian approach to incorporating uncertain event times into joint models.
Specifically, we consider the event time as a submodel-derived quantity from a hierarchical regression model akin to @lu_using_1993.
We call this submodel the _uncertain event time_ submodel and denote it $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \psi_{1}, Y_{1})$, where $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ is the event time.
The survival submodel $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{2}, Y_{2})$ uses $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$, the common quantity, as the response.
We treat the longitudinal submodel, $\pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{3}, Y_{3})$, separately from the survival submodel, as is common in two-stage survival modelling, and denote the subject-specific parameters that also appear in the survival model as $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$.
The high level submodel relationships are displayed as a DAG in Figure \ref{fig:surv-simple-dag}.
\input{tex-input/surv-example/0001-surv-simple-dag.tex}

## Markov melding

We now review Markov melding [@goudie_joining_2019] before detailing our proposed extension.
As noted in the introduction, Markov melding is a method for combining $\Nm$ submodels $\pd_{1}(\phi, \psi_{1}, Y_{1}), \ldots, \pd_{\Nm}(\phi, \psi_{\Nm}, Y_{\Nm})$ which share the same $\phi$.
When the submodel prior marginals $\pd_{\modelindex}(\phi)$ are identical, i.e. $\pd_{\modelindex}(\phi) = \pd(\phi)$ for all $\modelindex$, it is possible to combine the submodels using _Markov combination_ [@dawid_hyper_1993-1; @massa_combining_2010]
\input{tex-input/orig-markov-melding/0010-markov-combination.tex}
Markov combination is not immediately applicable when submodel prior marginals are distinct, so Goudie _et al._&nbsp;define a _marginal replacement_ procedure, where individual submodel prior marginals are replaced with a common marginal $\pd_{\text{pool}}(\phi) = h(\pd_{1}(\phi), \ldots, \pd_{\Nm}(\phi))$ which is the result of a pooling function $h$ that appropriately summarises all prior marginals (the choice of which is described below).
The result of marginal replacement is
\input{tex-input/orig-markov-melding/0011-marginal-replacement.tex}
Goudie _et al._&nbsp;show that $\pd_{\text{repl}, \modelindex}(\phi, \psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex})$ minimises the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between a distribution $\q(\phi, \psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex})$ and $\pd_{\modelindex}(\phi, \psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex})$ under the constraint that $\q(\phi) = \pd_{\text{pool}}(\phi)$, and that marginal replacement is valid when $\phi$ is a deterministic function of the other parameters in submodel $\modelindex$.
Markov melding joins the submodels via the Markov combination of the marginally replaced submodels
\input{tex-input/orig-markov-melding/0012-markov-melding.tex}

### Pooled prior

Goudie _et al._&nbsp;proposed forming $\pd_{\text{pool}}(\phi)$ using linear or logarithmic prior pooling [@ohagan_uncertain_2006]
\input{tex-input/orig-markov-melding/0020-orig-pooling.tex}
where $\lambda = (\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{\Nm})$ are nonnegative weights, which are chosen subjectively to ensure $\pd_{\text{pool}}(\phi)$ appropriately represents prior knowledge about the common quantity.
Two special cases of pooling are of particular interest.
_Product of experts (PoE) pooling_  [@hinton_training_2002] is a special case of logarithmic pooling that occurs when $\lambda_{\modelindex} = 1$ for all $\modelindex$.
_Dictatorial pooling_ is a special case of either pooling method when $\lambda_{\modelindex'} = 1$ and, for all $\modelindex \neq \modelindex'$, $\lambda_{\modelindex} = 0$.

# Chained model specification

Consider $\modelindex = 1, \ldots, \Nm$ submodels each with data $Y_{\modelindex}$ and parameters $\theta_{\modelindex}$ denoted $\pd_{\modelindex}(\theta_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex})$, with $\Nm \geq 3$.
We assume that the submodels are connected in a manner akin to a chain and so can be ordered such that only 'adjacent’ submodels in the chain have parameters in common.
Specifically we assume that submodels $\modelindex$ and $\modelindex + 1$ have some parameters $\phi_{\modelindex \cap \modelindex + 1}$ in common for $\modelindex = 1, \ldots, \Nm - 1$.
For notational convenience define $\phi_{1} = \phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{\Nm} = \phi_{\Nm-1 \cap \Nm}$ and $\phi_{\modelindex} = (\phi_{\modelindex - 1 \cap \modelindex}, \, \phi_{\modelindex \cap \modelindex + 1})$ for $\modelindex = 2, \ldots, \Nm - 1$, so that $\phi_{\modelindex} \subseteq \theta_{\modelindex}$ denotes the parameters in model $\modelindex$ shared with another submodel.
The submodel-specific parameters of submodel $\modelindex$ are thus $\psi_\modelindex = \theta_\modelindex \setminus \phi_\modelindex$.
Define the vector of all common quantities $\boldsymbol{\phi} = (\phi_{1}, \ldots, \phi_{\Nm}) = (\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \ldots, \phi_{\Nm - 1 \cap \Nm})$, and $\boldsymbol{\phi}_{-\modelindex}$ denotes the subvector of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ excluding the $\modelindex$\textsuperscript{th} element.
It will also be convenient to define $\boldsymbol{\psi} = (\psi_{1}, \ldots, \psi_{\Nm})$ and likewise $\boldsymbol{Y} = (Y_{1}, \ldots, Y_{\Nm})$.
Note that all components of $\boldsymbol{\phi}, \boldsymbol{\psi}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$ may themselves be vectors.

All submodels, and marginal and conditional distributions thereof, have density functions that are assumed to exist and integrate to one.
When considering conditional distributions we assume that the parameter being conditioned on has support in the relevant region.

## Extending marginal replacement

We now define the chained melded model by extending the marginal replacement procedure to submodels linked in a chain-like way.
The $\modelindex$\textsuperscript{th} marginally replaced submodel is
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/0001-chained-marginal-replacement.tex}
where $\pd_{\text{pool}}(\boldsymbol{\phi}) = g(\pd_{1}(\phi_{1}), \pd_{2}(\phi_{2}), \ldots, \pd_{\modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex}))$ is a pooling function that appropriately summarises all submodel prior marginals.
The second equality in Equation \eqref{eqn:chained-marginal-replacement} is because of the conditional independence $(\psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex} \indep \boldsymbol{\phi}_{-\modelindex}) \mid \phi_{\modelindex}$ that exists due to the chained relationship between submodels.
It is important to note that $\pd_{\text{repl}, \modelindex}(\boldsymbol{\phi}, \psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex})$ is defined on a larger parameter space than $\pd_{\modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex}, \psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex})$, as it includes $\boldsymbol{\phi}_{-\modelindex}$.
We discuss this choice in the following section.

Define $\pd_{\text{repl}, \modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex}, \psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex}) = \int \pd_{\text{repl}, \modelindex}(\boldsymbol{\phi}, \psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex})\text{d}\boldsymbol{\phi}_{-\modelindex}$.
Each marginally replaced submodel, as defined in Equation \eqref{eqn:chained-marginal-replacement}, minimises the following KL divergence
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/0003-chained-marginal-replacement-kl.tex}
where $\pd_{\text{pool}}(\phi_{\modelindex}) = \int \pd_{\text{pool}}(\boldsymbol{\phi})\text{d}\boldsymbol{\phi}_{-\modelindex}$.
We can thus interpret $\pd_{\text{repl}, \modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex}, \psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex})$ as a minimally modified $\pd_{\modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex}, \psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex})$ which admits $\pd_{\text{pool}}(\phi_{\modelindex})$ as a marginal.
Note that it is the combination of $\pd_{\text{repl}, \modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex}, \psi_{\modelindex}, Y_{\modelindex})$ and $\pd(\boldsymbol{\phi}_{-\modelindex} \mid \phi_{\modelindex})$ that uniquely determine \eqref{eqn:chained-marginal-replacement}.

We form the chained melded model by taking the Markov combination of the marginally replaced submodels
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/0010-melded-model-cond.tex}
Rewriting \eqref{eqn:melded-model-full} in terms of $\phi_{\modelindex \cap \modelindex + 1}$ for $\modelindex = 1, \ldots, \Nm - 1$ yields
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/0011-melded-model-general.tex}
Finally, we use _melded posterior_ $\pd_{\text{meld}}(\boldsymbol{\phi}, \boldsymbol{\psi} \mid \boldsymbol{Y}) \propto \pd_{\text{meld}}(\boldsymbol{\phi}, \boldsymbol{\psi}, \boldsymbol{Y})$ to refer to posterior of the chained melded model conditioned on all data,
and define the $\modelindex$\textsuperscript{th} _subposterior_ as $\pd_{\modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex}, \psi_{\modelindex} \mid Y_{\modelindex})$.

## Pooled prior

Specifying \eqref{eqn:melded-model-full} requires a joint prior for $\boldsymbol{\phi}$.
As in Markov melding we form the joint prior by pooling the marginal priors, selecting a pooling function $g$ that appropriately represents prior knowledge about the common quantities.
We define $\pd_{\text{pool}}(\boldsymbol{\phi})$ as a generic function of all prior marginals
\input{tex-input/pooled-prior-discussion/0030-pooled-prior-general-def.tex}
because we do not assume independence between the components of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$.

Two special cases of Equation \eqref{eqn:pooled-prior-general-def-two} are noteworthy.
Firstly, if all components of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ are independent, then we can form $\pd_{\text{pool}}(\boldsymbol{\phi})$ as the product of $\Nm - 1$ standard pooling functions $h_{\modelindex}$ defined in Section \ref{pooled-prior}
\input{tex-input/pooled-prior-discussion/0010-bad-alternative-one.tex}
A second case, in between complete dependence \eqref{eqn:pooled-prior-general-def-two} and independence \eqref{eqn:bad-alternative-one}, is that if $\pd_{\modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex - 1 \cap \modelindex}, \phi_{\modelindex \cap \modelindex + 1}) = \pd_{\modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex - 1 \cap \modelindex}) \pd_{\modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex \cap \modelindex + 1})$ then we can define
\input{tex-input/pooled-prior-discussion/0031-pooled-prior-split-def.tex}
without any additional assumptions.
That is, if any two consecutive components of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ are independent in the submodel containing both of them, we can divide the pooled prior specification problem into two pooling functions.
The smaller number of arguments to $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ make it is easier to choose appropriate forms for those functions.

Selecting an appropriate pooling function is not trivial given the many choices of functional form and pooling weights (which we discuss momentarily).
It is important that prior predictive visualisations of the pooled prior are produced [@gabry_visualization_2019; @gelman_bayesian_2020] to ensure that it suitably represents the available information.
A complication encountered in the chained melding setting is that standard linear and logarithmic pooling, as defined in Equations \eqref{eqn:orig-pooling-linear} and \eqref{eqn:orig-pooling-logarithmic}, are not immediately applicable when the submodels marginal distributions consider different parameters.
We now propose extensions to logarithmic, linear, and dictatorial pooling for use in the case of chained melding.

### Chained logarithmic pooling

Extending logarithmic pooling for chained Markov melding is straightforward.
We define the logarithmically pooled prior to be
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/0050-pooled-prior-overall.tex}
for nonnegative weight vector $\lambda = (\lambda_{1}, \ldots, \lambda_{\Nm})$.
Note that \eqref{eqn:pooled-prior-overall} does not imply independence between the elements of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ because
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/0051-pooled-prior-log-alt-def.tex}
When $\lambda_{1} = \lambda_{2} = \ldots = \lambda_{\Nm} = 1$ we obtain the special case of product-of-experts (PoE) pooling [@hinton_training_2002].

### Chained Linear pooling

Our generalisation of linear pooling to handle marginals of different variables is a two step procedure.
The first step forms intermediary pooling densities via standard linear pooling, using appropriate marginals of the relevant quantity
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/0080-M-model-linear-pooling.tex}
where $\lambda_{\modelindex} = (\lambda_{\modelindex, 1}, \lambda_{\modelindex, 2})$ are nonnegative pooling weights, and for $\modelindex = 2, \ldots, \Nm - 1$
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/00801-M-model-linear-pooling-component-def.tex}
For $\modelindex = 1$ and $\modelindex = \Nm$ the relevant marginals are $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ and $\pd_{\Nm}(\phi_{\Nm - 1 \cap \Nm})$.
In step two we form the pooled prior as the product of the intermediaries
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/0055-silly-linear-overall.tex}
with
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/00551-linear-normalising-constant.tex}
Clearly, this assumes prior independence amongst all components of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ which may be undesirable, particularly if this independence was not present under one or more of the original sub-model priors.
We discuss extensions to linear pooling that enable prior dependence between the components of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ in Section \ref{conclusion}.

### Dictatorial pooling

Chained Markov melding does not admit a direct analogue to dictatorial pooling as defined in Section \ref{pooled-prior} because not all submodel prior marginals contain all common quantities.
For example, consider the logarithmically pooled prior of Equation \eqref{eqn:pooled-prior-overall} with, say, the $\modelindex^{\prime}$th entry in $\lambda$ set to $1$ and all others set to $0$.
This choice of $\lambda$ results in $\pd_{\text{pool}}(\boldsymbol{\phi}) = \pd(\phi_{\modelindex^{\prime}})$, which is flat for $\boldsymbol{\phi}_{-\modelindex^{\prime}}$.
It seems reasonable to require any generalisation of dictatorial pooling to result in a reasonable prior for all components in $\boldsymbol{\phi}$.
Such a generalisation should also retain the original intention of dictatorial pooling, i.e.&nbsp;'_the authoritative prior for_ $\phi_{\modelindex}$ _is_ $\pd_{\modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex})$'.

We propose two possible forms of dictatorial pooling that satisfy the aforementioned criteria.
The first considers $\pd_{\modelindex}(\phi_{\modelindex})$ as the authoritative prior for $\phi_{\modelindex}= (\phi_{\modelindex - 1 \cap \modelindex}, \phi_{\modelindex \cap \modelindex + 1})$.
This results in,
\input{tex-input/pooled-prior-discussion/0040-dictatorial-one-submodel.tex}
where $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$ are linear or logarithmic pooling functions as desired[^end-of-chain].

[^end-of-chain]: Some care is required if the authoritative submodel is $\pd_{\modelindex}$ for $\modelindex \in \{1, 2, M - 1, M\}$. If it is taken to be $\modelindex \in \{1, 2\}$, then $g_{1}$ does not exist, and additionally in the $\modelindex = 1$ case $\pd_{1}(\phi_{0 \cap 1}, \phi_{1 \cap 2}) \coloneqq \pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$. The $\modelindex \in \{\Nm - 1, \Nm\}$ cases have analogous definitions.

In our second proposal we require each component in $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ to be associated with only one submodel.
For $\modelindex = 1, \ldots, \Nm - 1$, the $\modelindex$\textsuperscript{th} marginal of the pooled prior is either
\input{tex-input/pooled-prior-discussion/0043-dictatorial-def-three.tex}
If two consecutive marginals are chosen such that
\input{tex-input/pooled-prior-discussion/0044-dictatorial-def-three-part-two.tex}
then we instead define
\input{tex-input/pooled-prior-discussion/0045-dictatorial-def-three-part-three.tex}
to preserve any dependence between $\phi_{\modelindex - 1 \cap \modelindex}$ and $\phi_{\modelindex \cap \modelindex + 1}$ that may be present under $\pd_{\modelindex}$.
For example, if $\Nm = 5$ and we wish to associate $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ with $\pd_{1}$, both $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$ and $\phi_{3 \cap 4}$ with $\pd_{3}$, and $\phi_{4 \cap 5}$ with $\pd_{5}$, then
\input{tex-input/pooled-prior-discussion/0046-dictatorial-def-two-example-one.tex}

### Pooling weights

Choosing values for the pooling weights is an important step in specifying the pooled prior.
Because appropriate values for the weights depend on the submodels being pooled and the information available a priori, universal recommendations are impossible, so we illustrate the impact of different choices in a straightforward example.
Figure \ref{fig:pooled_densities_plot} illustrates how $\lambda$ and the choice of pooling method impacts $\pd_{\text{pool}}(\boldsymbol{\phi})$ when pooling normal distributions.
Specifically, we consider $\Nm = 3$ submodels and pool
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/0061-marginal-gaussian-example.tex}
where $\text{N}(\phi; \mu, \sigma^{2})$ is the normal density function with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$ (or covariance matrix where appropriate).
The two dimensional density function $\pd_{2}$ has an additional parameter $\rho$, which controls the intra-submodel marginal correlation.
We set $\mu_{1} = -2.5, \mu_{2} = \left[\mu_{2, 1} \,\, \mu_{2, 2}\right]' = \left[0 \,\, 0\right]', \mu_{3} = 2.5, \sigma_{1}^{2} = \sigma_{2}^{2} = \sigma_{3}^{2} = 1$ and $\rho = 0.8$.
In the logarithmic case we set $\lambda_{1} = \lambda_{3}$ and parameterise $\lambda_{2} = 1 - 2\lambda_{1}$, so that $\lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2} + \lambda_{3} = 1$ whilst limiting ourselves to varying only $\lambda_{1}$.
Similarly, in the linear case we set $\lambda_{1, 1} = \lambda_{2, 2} = \lambda_{1}$ and $\lambda_{1, 2} = \lambda_{2, 1} = 1 - 2 \lambda_{1}$.
We consider 5 evenly spaced values of $\lambda_{1} \in [0, 0.5]$.

```{r pooled_densities_plot, out.width = '0.95\\linewidth', fig.cap = "Contour plots of $\\pd_{\\text{pool}}(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})$ (red) under logarithmic and linear pooling (left and right column respectively). The three original densities $\\pd_{1}(\\phi_{1 \\cap 2})$, $\\pd_{3}(\\phi_{2 \\cap 3})$ and $\\pd_{2}(\\phi_{1 \\cap 2}, \\phi_{2 \\cap 3})$ are shown in blue, with the univariate densities shown on the appropriate axis. The pooling weight parameter $\\lambda_{1}$ is indicated in the plot titles."}
knitr::include_graphics("plots/pooling-tests/version-two.pdf")
```

For both pooling methods, as the weight $\lambda_{1}$ associated with models $\pd_{1}$ and $\pd_{3}$ increases, the relative contributions of $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ and $\pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3})$ increase.
Note the lack of correlation in $\pd_{\text{pool}}$ under linear pooling (right column of Figure \ref{fig:pooled_densities_plot}) due to Equation \eqref{eqn:silly-linear-overall}.
A large, near-flat plateau is visible in the $\lambda_{1} = 0.25$ and $\lambda_{1} = 0.375$ cases, which is a result of the mixture of four, 2-D normal distributions that linear pooling produces in this example.
The logarithmic pooling process produces a more concentrated prior for small values of $\lambda_{1}$, and does not result in a priori independence between $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$.
Appendix&nbsp;\ref{log-pooling-gaussian-densities} shows analytically that $\lambda_{2}$ controls the quantity of correlation present in $\pd_{\text{pool}}$ in this setting.

# Posterior estimation

We now present a multi-stage MCMC method for generating samples from the melded posterior.
By employing a multi-stage strategy we can avoid evaluating all submodels simultaneously.
This is desirable in situations where simultaneously evaluating the submodel terms is computationally infeasible or cumbersome, whilst evaluating the prior marginal distributions is possible and relatively inexpensive.
By parallelising the multi-stage process we can produce posterior samples in less time than an equivalent sequential method[^sequential].

Multi-stage posterior estimation methods including @lunn:etal:13, @tom:etal:10, and @mauff_joint_2020, are employed when a single-stage MCMC sampler for the posterior distribution is infeasible.
This is often the case when applying chained melding; it is feasible to fit each submodel separately using standard methods, but when the submodels are combined -- either through Markov melding, or by expanding the definition of one submodel to include another -- the computation required poses an insurmountable barrier to posterior estimation.

We also describe an approximate method, where stage one submodels are summarised by normal distributions for use in stage two.

We only consider the $\Nm = 3$ case, as this setting includes both of our examples.
Generic, parallel methodology for efficiently sampling the melded posterior composed of arbitrary numbers of submodels is challenging, and beyond the scope of this article.
We discuss some of difficulties in Section \ref{conclusion}.

[^sequential]: Appendix \ref{sequential-sampler} describes such a sequential MCMC sampler.

## Parallel sampler

We now devise a strategy where stage one samples submodels 1 and 3 in parallel.
Stage two reuses these samples in a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler, which targets the full melded posterior.
The stage specific targets are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:parallel-dag}.

\input{tex-input/dc-sampler/0001-parallel-dag.tex}

The parallel sampler assumes that the pooled prior decomposes such that
\input{tex-input/dc-sampler/0002-parallel-decomposition.tex}
All pooled priors trivially satisfy \eqref{eqn:parallel-decomposition} by assuming $\pd_{\text{pool}, 1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ and $\pd_{\text{pool}, 3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3})$ are improper, flat distributions.
Another assumption we commonly employ is that $\pd_{\text{pool}, 1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}) = \pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ and $\pd_{\text{pool}, 3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}) = \pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3})$, with appropriate adjustments to $\pd_{\text{pool}, 2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$.
We shall see momentarily that this ensures that the stage one targets are the subposteriors of $\pd_{1}$ and $\pd_{3}$.

#### Stage one

Two independent, parallel sampling processes occur in stage one.
Terms from the melded model that pertain to $\pd_{1}$ and $\pd_{3}$ are isolated and targeted
\input{tex-input/dc-sampler/0021-stage-one-targets.tex}
using standard MCMC methodology.
This produces $N_{1}$ samples $\{(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \psi_{1})_{n}\}_{n = 1}^{N_{1}}$ from $\pd_{\text{meld}, 1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \psi_{2} \mid Y_{1})$ and $N_{3}$ samples $\{(\phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{3})_{n}\}_{n = 1}^{N_{3}}$ from $\pd_{\text{meld}, 3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{3} \mid Y_{3})$.

#### Stage two

Stage two targets the melded posterior of Equation \eqref{eqn:melded-model-full} using a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler, where the proposal distributions are
\input{tex-input/dc-sampler/0031-stage-two-proposals.tex}
where $\q(\psi_{2}^{*} \mid \psi_{2})$ is a generic proposal distribution for $\psi_{2}$.
In practice, we draw an index $n_{1}^{*}$ uniformly from $\{1, \ldots, N_{1}\}$ and use the corresponding value $(\phi_{1 \cap 2}^{*}, \psi_{1}^{*})_{n_{1}^{*}}$ as the proposal, doing likewise for $n_{3}^{*}$ and $(\phi_{2 \cap 3}^{*}, \psi_{3}^{*})_{n_{3}^{*}}$.
The acceptance probabilities for these updates are
\input{tex-input/dc-sampler/0032-stage-two-acceptance.tex}
where $\alpha(x, z)$ denotes the probability associated with a move from $z$ to $x$.
Note that all stage two acceptance probabilities only contain terms from the second submodel and the pooled prior, and thus do not depend on $\psi_{1}$ or $\psi_{3}$.
If a move is accepted then we also store the index, i.e. $n_{1}^{*}$ or $n_{3}^{*}$, associated with the move, otherwise we store the current value of the index.
The stored indices are used to appropriately resample $\psi_{1}$ and $\psi_{3}$ from the stage one samples.

## Normal approximations to submodel components

Normal approximations are commonly employed to summarise submodels for subsequent use in more complex models.
For example, two-stage meta-analyses often use a normal distribution centred on each studies' effect estimate [@burke_meta-analysis_2017].
Suppose we employ such an approximation to summarise the prior and posterior of $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$ under $\pd_{1}$ and $\pd_{3}$ respectively.
In addition, assume that

- Such approximations are appropriate for $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}), \pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2} \mid Y_{1}), \pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3})$, and $\pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3} \mid Y_{3})$.
- We are not interested in $\psi_{1}$ and $\psi_{3}$, and can integrate them out of all relevant densities.
- We employ our second form of dictatorial pooling and choose $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$ as the authoritative prior.

The latter two assumptions imply that the melded posterior of interest is proportional to
\input{tex-input/multiple-normal-approximation/0010-normal-approx-melded-posterior-target.tex}

Denote the normal approximation of $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2} \mid Y_{1})$ as $\widehat{\pd}_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2} \mid \widehat{\mu}_{1}, \widehat{\Sigma}_{1})$, which is a normal distribution with mean $\widehat{\mu}_{1}$ and covariance matrix $\widehat{\Sigma}_{1}$.
The corresponding normal approximation of the prior $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ is $\widehat{\pd}_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2} \mid \widehat{\mu}_{1, 0}, \widehat{\Sigma}_{1, 0})$.
The equivalent approximations for the subposterior and prior of $\pd_{3}$ are $\widehat{\pd}_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3} \mid \widehat{\mu}_{3}, \widehat{\Sigma}_{3})$ and $\widehat{\pd}_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3} \mid \widehat{\mu}_{3, 0}, \widehat{\Sigma}_{3, 0})$ respectively.
Substituting in the approximations and using standard results for Gaussian density functions (see @bromiley_products_2003 and Appendix \ref{normal-approximation-calculations}) results in
\input{tex-input/multiple-normal-approximation/0040-final-normal-approx.tex}
where
\input{tex-input/multiple-normal-approximation/0050-in-text-normal-approx.tex}
Standard MCMC methods can be used to sample from the approximate melded posterior.
If instead we opt for product-of-experts pooling, all $\widehat{\mu}_{\text{de}}$ and $\widehat{\Sigma}_{\text{de}}$ terms disappear from the parameter definitions in Equation \eqref{eqn:in-text-normal-approx}.


# Examples

- what are we trying to show with these examples? (if answering this was easy I would have written it down already!)
- That the melding approach encompasses, and is more general than, a number of other common forms of combining models.
- The first example compares chained melding to the normal approximation approach, where subposteriors are approximated by normal distributions and used as priors in later analyses. In this example, the normal approximation is good and both approaches yield similar results.
- The second example compares the point estimate approach, were a point estimate from an earlier model is used in later models. For example, the non-Bayesian methods discussed in @ma_current_2019 propagate the point estimates of the marginal dose-response curves for use in estimating the synergistic effects of a two-drug interaction surface. In our example, accounting for the uncertainty in earlier models notable changes the final results; the melded posterior estimates are substantially more uncertain, and have also been shifted (in terms of mean).
- The disparate fields from which we have drawn our examples illustrate the wide-applicability of chained melding.

## An Integrated population model for little owls

We now return to the integrated population model (IPM) for the little owls introduced in Section \ref{an-integrated-population-model-for-little-owls}.
@finke_efficient_2019 consider a number of variations on the original model of @schaub_local_2006 and @abadi_estimation_2010: here we consider only the variant from @finke_efficient_2019 with the highest marginal likelihood (Model 4 of their online supplement).

### Submodels

Before we detail the specifics of each submodel, we must introduce some notation.
Data and parameters are stratified into two age-groups $a \in \{J, A\}$ where $J$ denotes juvenile owls (less than one year old) and $A$ adults, two sexes $s \in \{M, F\}$, and observations occur annually at times $t \in \{1, \ldots, T\}$, with $T = 25$.
The sex- and age-specific probability of an owl surviving from time $t$ to $t + 1$ is $\delta_{a, s, t}$, and the sex-specific probability of a previously captured owl being recaptured at time $t + 1$ is $\pi_{s, t + 1}$ so long as the owl is alive at time $t + 1$.

#### Capture recapture: $\pd_{1}$

Capture-recapture data pertain to owls that are released at time $t$ (having been captured and tagged), and then recaptured at time $u = t + 1, \dots, T$, or not recaptured before the conclusion of the study, in which case $u = T + 1$.
Define $M_{a, s, t, u}$ as the number of owls of age-group $a$ and sex $s$ last observed at time $t$, recaptured at time $u$.
We aggregate these observations into age- and sex-specific matrices $\boldsymbol{M}_{a, s}$, with $T$ rows, corresponding to release times, and $T + 1$ columns, corresponding to recapture times.
Let $R_{a, s, t} = \sum_{u = 1}^{T + 1} M_{a, s, t, u}$ be the number of owls released at time $t$, i.e. a vector containing the row-wise sum of the entries in $\boldsymbol{M}_{a, s}$.
The recapture times for owls released at time $t$ follow a age- and sex-specific multinomial likelihood
\input{tex-input/owls-example/0010-capture-recapture-submodel.tex}
with probabilities $\boldsymbol{Q}_{a, s, t} = (Q_{a, s, t, 1}, \ldots, Q_{a, s, t, T + 1})$ such that
\input{tex-input/owls-example/0011-multinomial-probabilities.tex}

#### Count data model: $\pd_{2}$

To estimate population abundance, a two level model is used: the first level models the observed (counted) number of females at each point in time denoted $y_{t}$, with a second, latent process modelling the total number of females in population.
Denote the total number of juvenile and adult females in the population at time $t$ as $x_{t} = x_{J, t} + x_{A, t}$.
If $\text{sur}_{t}$ adult females survive from time $t - 1$ to time $t$, and $\text{imm}_{t}$ adult females immigrate over the same time period, then the latent, population level model is
\input{tex-input/owls-example/0020-count-data-submodel.tex}
where $\eta_{t}$ is the immigration rate.
The initial population sizes $x_{J, 1}$ and $x_{A, 1}$ have independent discrete uniform priors on $\{0, 1, \ldots, 50\}$.
The observation model is
\input{tex-input/owls-example/0021-observation-process.tex}

#### Fecundity: $\pd_{3}$

The fecundity submodel considers the number of breeding females at time $t$ denoted $N_{t}$, and the number of chicks produced that survive and leave the nest denoted $n_{t}$.
A Poisson model is employed to estimate fecundity (reproductive rate) $\rho$
\input{tex-input/owls-example/0030-fecundity-submodel.tex}

#### Parameterisation and melding quantities

@abadi_estimation_2010 parameterise the time dependent quantities via linear predictors, to minimise the number of parameters in the submodels.
The specific parameterisation of @finke_efficient_2019 we employ is
\input{tex-input/owls-example/0040-parameterisation-info.tex}
thus the quantities in common between the submodels are $\phi_{1 \cap 2} = (\alpha_{0}, \alpha_{2})$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3} = \rho$.
Not that the definition of $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ does not include $\alpha_{1}$ as it is male specific and does not exist in $\pd_{2}$.
The model variant of @finke_efficient_2019 we consider does not include $\alpha_{3}$, and for comparability we keep the other parameter indices the same.

To align the notation of this example with our chained melding notation we define, for all permitted values of $a, s$ and $t$, $Y_{1} = (\boldsymbol{M}_{a, s})$, $\psi_{1} = \left(\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{4}, (\alpha_{5, u})_{u = 2}^{T + 1}\right)$; $Y_{2} = (y_{t})$, $\psi_{2} = (x_{J, t}, \alpha_{6}, \text{sur}_{t}, \text{imm}_{t})$; and $Y_{3} = (N_{t}, n_{t})$, $\psi_{3} = \varnothing$.

#### Priors

We use the priors of @finke_efficient_2019 for the parameters in each submodel.
Denote $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (\alpha_{0}, \alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \alpha_{4}, \alpha_{6})$.
In both $\pd_{1}$ and $\pd_{2}$ the elements of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ are assigned independent $\text{Normal}(0, 2^2)$ priors truncated to $[-10, 10]$.
The time varying recapture probabilities $\alpha_{5, u}$ also have $\text{Normal}(0, 2^2)$ priors truncated to $[-10, 10]$.
A $\text{Uniform}(0, 10)$ prior is assigned to $\rho$ in $\pd_{2}$ and $\pd_{3}$.

To completely specify $\pd_{\text{meld}}$ we must choose how to form $\pd_\text{pool}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$.
We form $\pd_\text{pool}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$ using three different pooling methods and estimate the melded posterior in each case.
The first pooling method is product-of-experts (PoE) pooling, which is logarithmic pooling with $\lambda = (1, 1, 1)$, and we denote the melded posterior as $\pd_{\text{meld, PoE}}$.
We also use logarithmic pooling with $\lambda = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$, which is denoted $\pd_{\text{meld, log}}$.
The final pooling method is linear pooling with $\lambda = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$, denoted $\pd_{\text{meld, lin}}$.

### Posterior estimation

We estimate the melded posterior -- $\pd_{\text{meld}}(\boldsymbol{\phi}, \boldsymbol{\psi} \mid \boldsymbol{Y})$, proportional to Equation \eqref{eqn:melded-model-full} -- using both the parallel sampler (Section \ref{parallel-sampler}) and normal approximation (Section \ref{normal-approximations-to-submodel-components}).
This allows us to use pre-existing implementations of the submodels.
Specifically, the capture-recapture submodel is written in BUGS [@lunn_bugs_2009] and sampled via `rjags` [@plummer_rjags_2019].
The fecundity submodel is written in Stan [@carpenter_stan_2017] and sampled via `rstan` [@stan_development_team_rstan_2021].
The count data submodel is also written in BUGS, and we reuse this implementation in stage two of the multi-stage sampler via `Nimble` [@de_valpine_programming_2017] and its `R` interface [@nimble_development_team_nimble_2019].
The approximate melded posterior obtained by Section \ref{normal-approximations-to-submodel-components} is sampled using `rjags`.

Code and data for all examples are available at [https://github.com/hhau/melding-multiple-phi](https://github.com/hhau/melding-multiple-phi).
__TODO:__ Swap this for a Zenodo DOI
Trace plots and numerical convergence measures [@vehtari_rank-normalization_2020] for both stages of the parallel sampling process are also available in the online repository.

knitr::include_graphics("plots/owls-example/subposteriors-both-patchwork.pdf")
```

We empirically validate our methodology and sampler by comparing the melded posterior samples to a large sample -- 6 chains, each containing $1 \times 10^5$ post-warmup iterations -- from the original IPM posterior.
Note that under logarithmic pooling with $\lambda = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ the melded posterior is identical to the original IPM, so any differences are attributable to the multi-stage sampler.
Figure \ref{fig:phi_subpost} depicts the posterior credible intervals [@gabry_bayesplot_2021; @kay_tidybayes_2020] for the common quantities from the individual submodels, the melded models, and the original IPM.
The top row in Figure \ref{fig:phi_subpost} indicates that the count data alone ($\pd_{2}$) contain minimal information about $\alpha_{0}, \alpha_{2}$ and $\rho$; incorporating the data from the other submodels is essential for precise estimates.

The melded posterior estimates are generally similar to the original IPM estimate,
PoE pooling produces the posterior most different from the original IPM, as it yields a prior for $(\alpha_{0}, \alpha_{2})$ that is more concentrated around zero than the other pooling methods.
The lack of large differences between the melded posteriors that use different pooled priors indicates that the prior has almost no effect on the posterior.
The similarity of the approximate approach ($\widehat{\pd}_{\text{meld}}$ - bottom row of Figure \ref{fig:phi_subpost}) to the melding approaches suggests that the normal approximations are good summaries of the subposteriors.

## Survival analysis with time varying covariates and uncertain event times

We now return to the example introduced in Section \ref{survival-analysis-with-time-varying-covariates-and-uncertain-event-times}.
There are $i = 1, \ldots, N$ individuals in the data set.
Each individual is admitted to the ICU at time $0$, and is discharged or dies at time $C_{i}$.
See Appendix \ref{cohort-selection-criteria} for information on how the $N = 37$ individuals were selected from MIMIC-III [@johnson_mimic-iii_2016].

### P/F ratio submodel (B-spline): $\pd_{1}$

Each individual has P/F ratio observations $z_{i, j}$ (in units of mmHg) at times $t_{i, j}$, with $j = 1, \ldots, J_{i}$.
For each individual denote the vector of observations $\boldsymbol{z}_{i} = (z_{i, 1}, \ldots, z_{i, J_{i}})$ and observation times $\boldsymbol{t}_{i} = (t_{i, 1}, \ldots, t_{i, J_{i}})$.
To improve computational performance, we standardise the P/F ratio data for each individual such that $z_{i, j} = \frac{\tilde{z}_{i, j} - \overline{z}_{i}}{\hat{s}_{i}}$, where $\tilde{z}_{i, j}$ is the underlying unstandardised observation with mean $\overline{z}_{i}$ and standard deviation $\hat{s}_{i}$.
Similarly we rescale the threshold for respiratory failure: $\tau_{i} = \frac{300 - \overline{z}_{i}}{\hat{s}_{i}}$.

We choose to model the P/F ratio using cubic B-splines and 7 internal knots, and do not include an intercept column in the spline basis [for background on B-splines see: Chapter 2 in @hastie_generalized_1999; and the supplementary material of @wang_shape-restricted_2021-1].
The internal knots are evenly spaced between two additional boundary knots at $\min(\boldsymbol{t}_{i})$ and $\max(\boldsymbol{t}_{i})$.
These choices result in $k = 1, \ldots, 10$ spline basis terms per individual, with coefficients $\zeta_{i, k}$ where $\boldsymbol{\zeta}_{i} = (\zeta_{i, 1}, \ldots, \zeta_{i, 10})$.
We denote the individual specific B-spline basis evaluated at time $t_{i, j}$ as $B_{i}(t_{i, j}) \in [0, \infty)^{10}$ so that the submodel can be written as
\input{tex-input/mimic-example/0010-pf-model-def.tex}
We employ a weakly informative prior for the intercept, and a heavy tailed ($t_{5}$) distribution for the error term[^pfoutliers] with a weakly informative half-normal prior for the unknown scale parameter
\input{tex-input/mimic-example/0011-pf-model-priors-simple.tex}
For the spline basis coefficients we set $\zeta_{i, 1} \sim \text{N}(0, 0.1^2)$, and for $k = 2, \ldots, 10$ we employ the random-walk prior $\zeta_{i, k} \sim \text{N}(\zeta_{i, k - 1}, 0.1^2)$ from @kharratzadeh_splines_2017.

[^pfoutliers]: P/F data contain many outliers for, amongst many possible reasons, arterial/venous blood sample mislabelling; incorrectly recorded oxygenation support information; and differences between sample collection time, lab result time, and the observation time as recorded in the EHR.

We identify that a respiratory failure event $d_{i} = 1$ occurred at event time $T_{i}$ if a solution to the following optimisation problem exists 
\input{tex-input/mimic-example/0012-event-time-model-def.tex}
We attempt to solve Equation \ref{eqn:event-time-model-def} using a standard multiple root finder [@soetaert_rootsolve_2020].
If there are no roots then the individual died or was discharged before respiratory failure occurred so we set $T_{i} = C_{i}$ and $d_{i} = 0$.
The relationship between $T_{i}$ and other model coefficients is displayed in the left hand panel of Figure \ref{fig:submodel-schematics}.

### Cumulative fluid submodel (piecewise linear) $\pd_{3}$

We model the 8-hourly cumulative fluid balance data $x_{i, l}$ (in litres) at times $u_{i, l}$, $l = 1, \ldots, L_{i}$.
The cumulative data are derived from the raw fluid input/output observations, which we detail in Appendix&nbsp;\ref{calculating-the-cumulative-fluid-balance-from-the-raw-fluid-data}.
We denote the complete vector of observations by $\boldsymbol{x}_{i} = (x_{i, 1}, \ldots, x_{i, L_{i}})$ and times by $\boldsymbol{u}_{i} = (u_{i, 1}, \ldots, u_{i, L_{i}})$.

We assume a piecewise linear model with $\eta_{0, i}$ as the value at the breakpoint at time $\kappa_{i}$, slope $\eta_{1, i}^{b}$ before the breakpoint, and slope $\eta_{1, i}^{a}$ after the breakpoint.
We write this submodel as
\input{tex-input/mimic-example/0020-piecewise-fluid-model.tex}
It will be useful to refer to the fitted value of this submodel at arbitrary time as $m_{i}(t)$.
We assume a weakly informative prior for the error term, with individual-specific error variances
\input{tex-input/mimic-example/0021-fluid-submodel-noise-priors.tex}
and specific, informative priors for the slopes
\input{tex-input/mimic-example/0022-fluid-submodel-slope-priors.tex}
An appropriate prior for $\kappa_{i}$ and $\eta_{0, i}$ is challenging to specify due to the relationship between the two parameters and the individual-specific support for $\kappa_{i}$.
We address both challenges by reparameterisation, resulting in a prior for $\kappa_{i}$ that, in the absence of other information, places the breakpoint in the middle of an individuals ICU stay, and a prior for $\eta_{0, i}$ that captures the diverse pathways into ICU that an individual can experience.
Details and justifications for all the informative priors are available in Appendix&nbsp;\ref{priors-and-justification-for-the-cumulative-fluid-submodel}.
Figure \ref{fig:submodel-schematics} displays the parameters and their relationship to the fitted regression line.

### Survival submodel $\pd_{2}$

Individuals experience respiratory failure ($d_{i} = 1$) at arbitrary time $0 < t < C_{i}$, or are censored[^competerisks] $(d_{i} = 0, t = C_{i})$.
We assume a Weibull hazard with shape parameter $\gamma$ for the event times.
All individuals have $a = 1, \ldots, A$ baseline (time invariant) covariates $w_{i, a}$ with $\boldsymbol{w}_{i} = (1, w_{i, 1}, \ldots, w_{i, A})$(i.e. including an intercept term), and common coefficients $\boldsymbol{\theta} =  (\theta_{0}, \ldots, \theta_{A})$.
The hazard is assumed to be influenced by these covariates and the rate of increase $\frac{\partial}{\partial t} m_{i}(t)$ in the cumulative fluid balance.
The strength of the latter relationship is captured by $\alpha$.
Hence, the hazard is
\input{tex-input/mimic-example/0030-surv-submodel-def.tex}
The survival function at an individual's observed event time and status, $(T_{i}, d_{i})$, denoted $S_{i}(T_{i}) = \exp\{-\int_{0}^{T_{i}}h_{i}(u)\text{d}u\}$, has an analytic form which we derive in Appendix&nbsp;\ref{analytic-form-for-the-survival-function}.
Hence the likelihood for individual $i$ is
\begin{equation}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i} \mid \gamma, \boldsymbol{\theta}, \alpha, \kappa_{i}, \eta_{1, i}^{b}, \eta_{1, i}^{a}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) = h_{i}(T_{i})^{d_{i}} S_{i}(T_{i}), \\
\end{equation}
where we suppress the dependence on the parameters on the right hand side for brevity.

Our priors, which we justify in Appendix&nbsp;\ref{p2-prior-justification}, for the submodel specific parameters are
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
  \gamma \sim \text{Gamma}(9.05, 8.72), \,\,
  \alpha \sim \text{SkewNormal}(0, 0.5, -2), \\
  \theta_{0} \sim \text{N}(\hat{E}, 0.5^2), \,\,
  \theta_{a} \sim \text{SkewNormal}(0, 0.5, -1)
  \label{eqn:surv-submodel-prior-def}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{E}$ is the log of the crude event rate [@brilleman_bayesian_2020].
We adopt the same priors as the cumulative fluid balance submodel for $\kappa_{i}, \eta_{1, i}^{b}$, and $\eta_{1, i}^{a}$.

[^competerisks]: The relationship between this model and the competing risks approach is discussed in Appendix&nbsp;\ref{a-comparison-with-the-competing-risk-approach}.

### Chained Markov melding details

To combine the submodels with chained Markov melding we must define the common quantities $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$.
We meld $\pd_{1}$ and $\pd_{2}$ by treating the derived event times and indicators $\{(T_{i}, d_{i})\}_{i = 1}^{N}$ under $\pd_{1}$ as the "response", i.e.&nbsp;event times, in $\pd_{2}$.
Care is required when defining $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ under $\pd_{1}$ as it is a deterministic function of $\beta_{0, i}$ and  $\boldsymbol{\zeta}_{i}$.
Define $\chi_{1, i} = (\beta_{0, i}, \boldsymbol{\zeta}_{i})$ and $\phi_{1 \cap 2, i} = f(\chi_{1, i}) = (T_{i}, d_{i})$, where $f$ is the output from attempting to solve Equation \eqref{eqn:event-time-model-def}, so that $\phi_{1 \cap 2} = (f(\chi_{1, i}), \ldots, f(\chi_{1, N}))$.
The parameters shared by Equations \eqref{eqn:piecewise-fluid-model} and \eqref{eqn:surv-submodel-def-two} constitute $\phi_{2 \cap 3} = (\eta^{b}_{1, i}, \eta^{a}_{1, i}, \kappa_{i})_{i = 1}^{N}$.

To completely align with our chained melding notation we also define, for the P/F submodel, $Y_{1} = (\boldsymbol{z}_{i}, \boldsymbol{t}_{i})_{i = 1}^{N}$ and $\psi_{1} = (\omega_{i})_{i = 1}^{N}$, noting that $\psi_{1}$ and $(\chi_{1, i}, \ldots, \chi_{1, N})$ have no components in common.
For the cumulative fluid submodel we define $Y_{3} = (\boldsymbol{x}_{i}, \boldsymbol{u}_{i})_{i = 1}^{N}$, and $\psi_{3} = (\eta_{0, i}, \sigma^{2}_{x, i})_{i = 1}^{N}$.
Finally, for the survival submodel we define $Y_{2} = (\boldsymbol{w}_{i})_{i = 1}^{N}$ and $\psi_{2} = (\gamma, \boldsymbol{\theta}, \alpha)$.


### Pooling and estimation

We consider logarithmic pooling with $\lambda = (\frac{4}{5}, \frac{4}{5}, \frac{4}{5})$ (any smaller value of $\lambda$ results in a prior that is so uninformative that it causes computational problems) and with $\lambda = (1, 1, 1)$ (Product-of-Experts).
Because the correlation between $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$ in $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$ is important, we do not consider linear pooling in this example.
Logarithmic pooling requires estimates of $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ and $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$.
Because these are mixed distributions, with both discrete and continuous components, standard kernel density estimation, as suggested by @goudie_joining_2019, is inappropriate.

Instead, we fit appropriate parametric mixture distributions to the unknown prior marginal distributions.
For $\pd_{1}$, we note that $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{N}\pd_{1, i}(T_{i}, d_{i})$, and that $\pd_{1, i}(T_{i}, d_{i})$ conditions on each individual's length of stay (in specifying the location of the knots), as well as the range, mean, and standard deviation of the P/F data (by standardising $\tilde{z}_{i, j}$).
Simple Monte Carlo samples are drawn from $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ and used to estimate $\widehat{\pd}_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$.
Under the second submodel we obtain samples from $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$ using the methodology of @crowther_simulating_2013 as implemented in `simsurv` [@brilleman_simsurv_2021].
These samples are use to estimate $\widehat{\pd}_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$.
Details for all the parametric mixture distribution estimates are contained in Appendix&nbsp;\ref{estimating-submodel-prior-marginal-distributions}.

We use the parallel multi-stage sampler with $\pd_{\text{pool}, 1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}) = \pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}), \,\, \pd_{\text{pool}, 3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}) = \pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3})$ and $\pd_{\text{pool}, 2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}) = \pd_{\text{pool}}(\boldsymbol{\phi}) \mathop{/} \left(\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}) \pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}) \right)$.
That is, in stage one we target the subposteriors $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \psi_{1} \mid Y_{1})$ and $\pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{3} \mid Y_{3})$; in stage two we target the full melded model.
The stage one subposteriors are sampled using `Stan`, using 5 chains with $10^{3}$ warm-up iterations and $10^{4}$ post warm-up iterations.
We use `Stan` to sample $\psi_{2}$ where, in every MH-within-Gibbs step, we run `Stan` for 9 warm-up iterations and 1 post warm-up iteration[^initialisation].
We run 5 chains of $10^{4}$ iterations for all stage two targets.
Visual and numerical diagnostics [@vehtari_rank-normalization_2020] are assessed and are available in the repository accompanying this paper.

[^initialisation]: We also initialise Stan at the previous value of $\psi_{2}$, and disable all adaptive procedures as the default (identity) mass matrix and step size are suitable for this example.

It is crucial for the convergence of our multi-stage sampler that $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$ are updated _individual-at-a-time_.
Appendix&nbsp;\ref{one-at-a-time} contains the details of this scheme.

### Results

```{r pf_fit_and_fluid_fit_plot, fig.cap = 'The P/F ratio data ($Y_{1}$, left column); cumulative fluid data ($Y_{3}$, right column, in litres); subposterior means and 95\\% credible intervals for each of the submodels (black solid lines and grey intervals); and stage one event times ($T_{i}$, red rug in left column) for individuals $i = 6, 15, 17$, and $29$.'}
knitr::include_graphics('plots/mimic-example/combined-pf-fluid-fit-plot-small.pdf')
```

We first inspect the subposterior fitted values for $\pd_{1}$ and $\pd_{3}$.
The left column of Figure \ref{fig:pf_fit_and_fluid_fit_plot} displays the P/F data, the fitted submodel, and derived event times for individuals $i = 6, 15, 17$, and $29$.
The spline appears to fit the raw P/F data well, with the heavy tailed error term accounting for the larger deviations away from the fitted value.
It is interesting to see the relatively wide, multimodal distribution for $(T_{29}, d_{29})$ (there is a second mode at $(T_{29} = C_{29}, d_{29} = 0)$ and for other individuals not shown here).
The right column of Figure \ref{fig:pf_fit_and_fluid_fit_plot} displays the cumulative fluid data and the fitted submodel for the same individuals.
There is little noise in these data which results in tight subposterior distributions for $\eta_{0, i}, \eta_{1, i}^{b}, \eta_{1, i}^{a}$ and $\kappa_{i}$, and hence minimal uncertainty about the fitted value.

To assess the importance of fulling accounting for the uncertainty in $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$, we compare the posterior for $\psi_{2}$ obtained using the chained melding approach with the posterior obtained by fixing $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$.
Plugging in a point estimate reflects common applied statistical practice when combining submodels, particularly when a distributional approximation is nontrival to obtain (as it is for $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2} \mid Y_{1})$).
Standard survival models and software are also a consideration, as they typically do not permit uncertainty in event times and indicators.

Specifically, we fix $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ to the median value[^median] for each individual under $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2} \mid Y_{1})$, which we denote $\widehat{\phi}_{1 \cap 2}$.
We fix $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$ to the subposterior mean of $\pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3} \mid Y_{3})$ similarly denoted $\widehat{\phi}_{2 \cap 3}$.
With these fixed values, we use standard MCMC methods to sample $\pd(\psi_{2} \mid \widehat{\phi}_{1 \cap 2}, \widehat{\phi}_{2 \cap 3}, Y_{2})$.
We also compare the melded posterior to the original marginal prior $\pd_{2}(\psi_{2})$, but we note that this comparison is difficult to interpret, as the melding process alters the prior for $\psi_{2}$.
Figure \ref{fig:psi_2_comparison_plot} displays the aforementioned densities for $(\theta_{3}, \theta_{17}, \gamma, \alpha) \subset \psi_{2}$, with $(\theta_{3}, \theta_{17})$ chosen as they exhibit the greatest sensitivity to the fixing of $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$.
For the baseline coefficients ($\theta_{3}, \theta_{17}$) the chained melding posterior differs slightly in location from $\pd(\psi_{2} \mid \widehat{\phi}_{1 \cap 2}, \widehat{\phi}_{2 \cap 3}, Y_{2})$, with a small increase in uncertainty.
A more pronounced change is visible for $\alpha$, where the melding process has added a notable degree of uncertainty and shifted the posterior leftwards.

[^median]: For each individual the samples of $(T_{i}, d_{i})_{i = 1}^{N}$-pairs are sorted by $T_{i}$, and the $\lfloor \frac{N}{2}\rfloor$\textsuperscript{th} tuple $(\widehat{T}_{i}, \widehat{d}_{i})$ is chosen as the median.

```{r psi_2_comparison_plot, fig.cap = 'Density estimates for a subset of $\\psi_{2}$. The original marginal prior $\\pd_{2}(\\psi_{2})$ is shown as the grey dotted line (note that this is not the marginal prior under the melded model). The figure also contains the subposteriors obtained from chained melding using PoE pooling (red, solid line) and logarithmic pooling (blue, solid line), as well as the posterior using the fixed values $\\pd(\\psi_{2} \\mid \\widehat{\\phi}_{1 \\cap 2}, \\widehat{\\phi}_{2 \\cap 3}, Y_{2})$ (black, dashed line).'}
knitr::include_graphics('plots/mimic-example/psi-2-method-comparison-small.pdf')
```

To investigate which part of the melding process causes this change in the posterior of $\alpha$, we consider fixing one or both of $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$ to their respective point estimates.
Figure \ref{fig:alpha_only_comparision_plot} displays the same distributions for $\alpha$ as Figure \ref{fig:psi_2_comparison_plot}, and adds the posteriors obtained using one fixed value ($\widehat{\phi}_{1 \cap 2}$ or $\widehat{\phi}_{2 \cap 3}$) whilst melding the other non-fixed parameter.
That is, we employ Markov melding as described in Section \ref{markov-melding}, using either logarithmic or PoE pooling, to obtain $\pd_{\text{meld}}(\alpha \mid \widehat{\phi}_{1 \cap 2}, Y_{2}, Y_{3})$ and $\pd_{\text{meld}}(\alpha \mid \widehat{\phi}_{2 \cap 3}, Y_{1}, Y_{2})$.
Evident for both choices of pooling is the importance of incorporating the uncertainty in $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$.
This is expected given the large uncertainty and multimodal nature of $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ compared to $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:pf_fit_and_fluid_fit_plot}).
We suspect that it is the multimodality in $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2} \mid Y_{1})$ that produces the shift in posterior mode of $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$, with the width of $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2} \mid Y_{1})$ affecting the increase in uncertainty.

```{r alpha_only_comparision_plot, fig.cap = 'Median (vertical line), 50\\%, 80\\%, 95\\%, and 99\\% credible intervals (least transparent to most transparent) for $\\alpha$. The marginal prior (grey, top row) and posterior using fixed $\\widehat{\\phi}_{1 \\cap 2}$ and $\\widehat{\\phi}_{2 \\cap 3}$ (black, bottom row) are as in Figure \\ref{fig:psi_2_comparison_plot}. For the chained melded posteriors (red and blue, rows 2 and 3) and the melded posteriors (red and blue, rows 4 -- 7), the tick label on the y-axis denotes the type of pooling used, and which of $\\phi_{1 \\cap 2}$ and/or $\\phi_{2 \\cap 3}$ are fixed.'}
knitr::include_graphics('plots/mimic-example/psi-2-alpha-only-compare.pdf')
```

The marginal changes to the components of $\psi_{2}$ visible in Figure \ref{fig:psi_2_comparison_plot} appear small, however the cumulative effect of such changes becomes apparent when inspecting the posterior of the survival function.
Figure \ref{fig:kap_meier_pc_plot} displays the model-based, mean survival function under the melded posterior (using PoE pooling), and corresponding draws of $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ converted into survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
Also shown are the Kaplan-Meier estimate of $\widehat{\phi}_{1 \cap 2}$ and the mean survival function computed using $\pd(\psi_{2} \mid \widehat{\phi}_{1 \cap 2}, \widehat{\phi}_{2 \cap 3}, Y_{2})$.
The posterior survival functions differ markedly, with the 95\% intervals overlapping only for small values of time.
It is also interesting to see that $\widehat{\phi}_{1 \cap 2}$, despite being a reasonable point estimate of $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2} \mid Y_{1})$, is not very likely under the melded posterior.
Figure \ref{fig:kap_meier_pc_plot} also suggests that the Weibull hazard is insufficiently flexible for this example.
We discuss the complexities of other hazards in Section \ref{conclusion}.

```{r kap_meier_pc_plot, fig.cap = 'Survival curves and mean survival function at time $t$. The red, stepped lines are draws of $\\phi_{1 \\cap 2}$ from the melded posterior using PoE pooling, converted into survival curves via the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The smooth red line and interval (posterior mean and 95\\% credible interval) denote the model-based, mean survival function obtained from the melded posterior (PoE pooling) values of $\\psi_{2}$ and $\\phi_{2 \\cap 3}$. The blue dashed line is the Kaplan-Meier estimate of $\\widehat{\\phi}_{1 \\cap 2}$, and the blue solid line and interval are the corresponding model-based estimate from $\\pd(\\psi_{2} \\mid \\widehat{\\phi}_{1 \\cap 2}, \\widehat{\\phi}_{2 \\cap 3}, Y_{2})$.'}

# Conclusion

This paper introduces the chained melded model.
In doing so we have made explicit the notion of submodels related in a chain-like way, which we illustrate with our examples.
Our examples also demonstrate the importance of quantifying the uncertainty when joining submodels; not doing so can produce biased, over-confident inference.

One contribution of our work is to make explicit the informal process of summarising and/or approximating submodels for use in subsequent analyses.
The two most common approximation strategies seem to be (i) approximating the subposterior of the common quantity with a normal distribution, which is used as a prior in subsequent models and (ii) taking only a point estimate of the subposterior, and treating it as a known value in further models.
These strategies may, but not always, produce acceptable approximations to the chained melded model.
Both the chained melded model and these approximation strategies are examples of 'multi-phase' and 'multi-source' inference [@meng_trio_2014], with the melding approach being the most sophisticated.

We have introduced extensions to linear and logarithmic pooling to marginals of different but overlapping parameters.
Linear pooling, introduced in Section \ref{pooled-prior}, could be extended to induce dependence between the components of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ using multivariate or vine copulas [@kurowicka_dependence_2011; @nelsen_introduction_2006], or other techniques [@lin_recent_2014]
Copula methods are particularly appealing as, depending on the choice of copula, they yield cheap to evaluate expressions for the density function, are easy to sample, and induce correlation between an arbitrary number of marginals.

Our parallel sampler is currently limited to $\Nm = 3$ submodels.
A general method would consider an arbitrary number of submodels in a chain, and initially split the chain into more/fewer pieces depending on the computational resources available.
Designing such a method is complex, as it would have to:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\tightlist
\item avoid requiring the inverse of any component of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ with a noninvertible definition,
\item estimate relative cost of sampling each submodel's subposterior, to split the chain of submodels into steps/jobs of approximately the same computational cost,
\item decide the order in which pieces of the chain are combined.
\end{itemize} \noindent
These are substantial challenges.
It may be possible to use combine the ideas in @lindsten_divide-and-conquer_2017, who propose a parallel Sequential Monte Carlo method, with the aforementioned constraints to obtain a generic methodology.
Ideally we would retain the ability to use existing implementations of the submodels, however the need to recompute the weights of the particles, and hence reevaluate previously considered submodels, may preclude this requirement.
Our currently sampler is also sensitive to large differences in location or scale of the target distribution between the stages; Sequential Monte Carlo samplers are likely to perform better in these settings.

The melding methodology is general and permits any form of uncertainty in the link parameters.
In Section \ref{survival-analysis-with-time-varying-covariates-and-uncertain-event-times} we use our chained melded model to incorporate uncertainty in the event times and indicators into a survival submodel.
We note that some specific forms of uncertainty have been considered in previous work.
These include @wang_integrative_2020, who consider uncertain event times arising from record linkage, where the event time is assumed to be one of a finite number of event times arising from the record linkage; and @giganti_accounting_2020, @oh_considerations_2018, and @oh_raking_2021, who leverage external validation data to account for measurement error in the event time.

The example in Section \ref{survival-analysis-with-time-varying-covariates-and-uncertain-event-times-1} has three more interesting aspects to discuss.
Firstly, the P/F ratio data used in the first submodel is obtained by finding all blood gas measurements from arterial blood samples.
Approximately $20\%$ of the venous/arterial labels are missing.
In these instances a logistic regression model, fit by the MIMIC team[^mimiclr], is used to predict the missing label based on other covariates.
No information is available about this model, however it is theoretically possible to refit the model in a Bayesian framework and use the chained melded model to incorporate the uncertainty in the predicted sample label.

[^mimiclr]: The coefficients, classification threshold, and the imputation used in the case of missing data are supplied in the `blood-gasses.sql` file in the GitHub repository accompanying this paper.

Secondly, the application of our multi-stage sampler to this example is similar to the two-stage approach used for joint longitudinal and time-to-event models [see @mauff_joint_2020 for a description of this approach].
In the two-stage approach, the longitudinal model is fit using standard MCMC methods in stage one, and the samples are reused in stage two when considering the time-to-event data.
This can significantly reduce the computational effort required to fit the joint model.
However, unlike our multi-stage sampler, the typical two-stage approach does not target the full posterior distribution, which can lead to biased estimates (though @mauff_joint_2020 extend the typical two-stage approach to reduce this bias).

Thirdly, we observe a lack of flexibility the baseline hazard, visible in Figure \ref{fig:kap_meier_pc_plot}.
More complex hazards could be employed, e.g. modelling the (log-)hazard using a (penalised) B-spline [@royston_flexible_2002; @rosenberg_hazard_1995; @rutherford_use_2015].
However, this increased flexibility precludes an analytic form for the survival function.
Whilst numerical integration is possible it is not trivial, particularly when the hazard is discontinuous, as our hazard is at the breakpoint.
Splines also have more coefficients than the single parameter of the Weibull hazard.
Identifiability issues arise with a small number of individuals, many of whom are censored, and are compounded when there are a relatively large number of other parameters $(\alpha, \boldsymbol{\theta})$.
Whilst we do not believe these costs are worth incurring for our example, for settings with a larger number of patients and more complicated longitudinal submodels the increased flexibility may be vital.

# Appendix {-}

## Log pooling Gaussian densities

We can exactly compute $\pd_{\text{pool}}$ when logarithmically pooling Gaussian densities.
Noting that, in the one dimensional case, $\text{N}(\phi; \mu, \sigma^2)^{\lambda_{\modelindex}} = \text{N}(\phi; \mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{\lambda_{\modelindex}})$, we use the results of @bromiley_products_2003 and write
\input{tex-input/multiple-phi/0070-log-pooling-gaussian.tex}
hence $\pd_{\text{pool}}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}) = \text{N}((\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3});\, \mu_{\text{log}}, \, \Sigma_{\text{log}})$.
The choice of $\lambda_{2}$ is critical; by controlling the contribution of $\pd_{2}$ to $\pd_{\text{pool}}$, $\lambda_{2}$ controls the degree of correlation present in the latter.
The left hand column of Figure \ref{fig:pooled_densities_plot} illustrates this phenomena.
When $\lambda_{1} = \lambda_{3} = 0 \implies \lambda_{2} = 1$, all correlation in $\pd_{2}$ is present in $\pd_{\text{pool}}$.
The correlation decreases for increasing values of $\lambda_{1}$ until $\lambda_{1} = \lambda_{3} = 0.5 \implies \lambda_{2} = 0$, where no correlation persists.

## Sequential sampler

The sequential sampler assumes that the pooled prior decomposes such that
\input{tex-input/multi-stage-sampler/0002-sequential-sampler-decomposition.tex}
This is necessary to avoid sampling all components of $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ in the first stage.
All pooled priors trivially satisfy \eqref{eqn:sequential-sampler-decomposition}, as we can assume all but $\pd_{\text{pool}, 3}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$ are improper, flat distributions.
However, including some portion of the pooled prior in each stage of the sampler can improve performance, and eliminate computational instabilities when submodel likelihoods contain little information.

### Stage one

Stage one of the sequential sampler targets
\input{tex-input/multi-stage-sampler/0020-stage-one-target.tex}
using a generic proposal kernel for both $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\psi_{1}$.
The corresponding acceptance probability for a proposed update from $(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \psi_{1})$ to $(\phi_{1 \cap 2}^{*}, \psi_{1}^{*})$ is
\input{tex-input/multi-stage-sampler/0021-stage-one-acceptance-probability.tex}

### Stage two

The stage two target augments the stage one target by including the second submodel, corresponding prior marginal distribution, and an additional pooled prior term
\input{tex-input/multi-stage-sampler/0030-stage-two-target.tex}
A Metropolis-within-Gibbs strategy is employed, where the stage one samples are used as a proposal for $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$, whilst a generic proposal kernel is used for $\psi_{2}$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$.
Thus the proposal distributions for $\phi_{1 \cap 2}^{*}$ and $(\phi_{2 \cap 3}^{*}, \psi_{2}^{*})$ are
\input{tex-input/multi-stage-sampler/0031-stage-two-gibbs-updates.tex}
The acceptance probability for this proposal strategy is
\input{tex-input/multi-stage-sampler/0032-stage-two-acceptance-probabilities.tex}
Our judicious choice of proposal distribution has resulted in a cancellation in Equation \eqref{eqn:stage-two-acceptance-probabilities-one} which removes all terms related to $\pd_{1}$.
Similarly, all terms related to $\pd_{1}$ are constant -- hence cancel -- in Equation \eqref{eqn:stage-two-acceptance-probabilities-two}.
This eliminates any need to re-evaluate the first submodel.

### Stage three

In stage three we target the full melded posterior
\input{tex-input/multi-stage-sampler/0044-stage-three-target.tex}
The target has now been broadened to include terms from the third submodel and the entirety of the pooled prior.
Again, we employ a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler, with proposals drawn such that
\input{tex-input/multi-stage-sampler/0045-stage-three-gibbs-updates.tex}
which leads to acceptance probabilities of
\input{tex-input/multi-stage-sampler/0046-stage-three-acceptance-probabilities.tex}
The informed choice of proposal distribution for ($\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{1}, \psi_{2}$) has allowed us to target the full melded posterior without needing to evaluate all submodels simultaneously.


## Normal approximation calculations

Substituting in the approximations of Section \ref{normal-approximations-to-submodel-components} to Equation \eqref{eqn:normal-approx-melded-posterior-target} yields the approximate melded posterior
\input{tex-input/multiple-normal-approximation/0020-normal-approximation-approximate-target.tex}
Noting that the product of independent normal densities is an unnormalised multivariate normal density with independent components, we rewrite Equation \eqref{eqn:normal-approximation-approximate-target} as
\input{tex-input/multiple-normal-approximation/0030-normal-approx-nu-de-form.tex}
The ratio of normal densities is also an unnormalised normal density, and hence Equation \eqref{eqn:normal-approx-nu-de-form} simplifies to
\input{tex-input/multiple-normal-approximation/0041-final-normal-approx-appendix.tex}

## Calculating the cumulative fluid balance from the raw fluid data

In the raw fluid data each patient has $\tilde{l} = 1, \ldots, \tilde{L}_{i}$ observations.
Each observation $\tilde{x}_{i, \tilde{l}}$ is typically a small fluid administration (e.g. an injection of some medicine in saline solution), or a fluid discharge (almost always urine excretion).
The observations have corresponding observation times $\tilde{u}_{i, \tilde{l}}$, with $\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i} = \{\tilde{u}_{i, 1}, \ldots, \tilde{u}_{i, \tilde{L}_{i}}\}$ and $\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}_{i} = \{\tilde{x}_{i, 1}, \ldots, \tilde{x}_{i, \tilde{L}_{i}}\}$.
We code the fluid administrations/inputs as positive values, and the excretions/outputs as negative values.
Each patient has an enormous number of raw fluid observations $(L_{i} \ll \tilde{L}_{i})$ and it is computationally infeasible to consider them all at once.
We aggregate the raw fluid observations into 8-hourly changes in fluid balance.
From these 8-hourly changes we calculate the cumulative fluid balance.

Mathematically, we define an ordered vector of boundary values
\begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{v}_{i} = (\lfloor \min\{\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i}\} \rfloor,  \lfloor \min\{\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i}\} \rfloor + \frac{1}{3}, \ldots, \lceil \max\{\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i}\} \rceil),
\end{equation}
noting that $\dim(\boldsymbol{v}_{i}) = L_{i} + 1$.
Because the observation times encoded as _days since ICU admission_ and we are interested in the 8-hourly changes, our floor and ceiling functions round down or up to the appropriate third respectively.
The raw fluid observations are then divided up into $L_{i}$ subsets of $\{\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}_{i}, \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i}\}$ based on which boundary values the observation falls in between:
\begin{equation}
  V_{i, l} = \left\{
    \{\tilde{\boldsymbol{x}}_{i}, \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i}\}
    \mid
    v_{i, l} \leq \tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i} < v_{i, l + 1}
  \right\},
\end{equation}
for $l = 1, \ldots, L_{i}$.
Denote $N^{V}_{i, l} = \lvert V_{i, l} \rvert \mathop{/} 2$ (dividing by two as $V_{i, l}$ contains both the observation and the observation time).
The $l$\textsuperscript{th} 8-hourly fluid change $\Delta_{i, l}$ and corresponding observation time $u_{i, l}$ can then be computed as
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{i, l} = \sum_{s = 1}^{N^{V}_{i, l}} \tilde{x}_{i, s}, \,\, \text{s.t.} \,\, \tilde{x}_{i, s} \in V_{i, l}, \qquad
  u_{i, l} = \frac{1}{N^{V}_{i, l}} \sum_{s = 1}^{N^{V}_{i, l}} \tilde{u}_{i, s}, \,\, \text{s.t.} \,\, \tilde{u}_{i, s} \in V_{i, l}.
\end{equation}
Finally, the 8-hourly cumulative fluid balance data are computed by $x_{i, l} = \sum_{s = 1}^{l} \Delta_{i, s}$, and we assume they too are observed at $u_{i, l}$.

## Priors and justification for the cumulative fluid submodel

The parameters for the gamma prior for $\eta^{b}_{1, i}$ and $\eta^{a}_{1, i}$ are obtained by assuming that the 2.5-, 50-, and 97.5- percentiles are at 0.5, 5, and 20 [@belgorodski_rriskdistributions_2017].
A slope of $0.5$ (i.e. the change in cumulative fluid balance per day) is unlikely but possible due to missing data; a slope of $20$ is also unlikely but possible as extremely unwell patients can have very high respiratory rates and thus require large fluid inputs.

The prior for the breakpoint $\kappa_{i}$ is derived as follows.
Define $u_{i, (1)} = \min(\boldsymbol{u}_{i})$ and $u_{i, (n)} = \max(\boldsymbol{u}_{i})$, with $r_{i} = u_{i, (n)} - u_{i, (1)}$.
We reparameterise the breakpoint by noting that $\kappa_{i} = \kappa^{\text{raw}}_{i}r_{i} + u_{i, (1)}$, where $\kappa^{\text{raw}} \in [0, 1]$.
We then set $\kappa^{\text{raw}}_{i} \sim \text{Beta}(5, 5)$ to regularise the breakpoint towards the middle of each individual's stay in ICU.
This is crucial to ensure the submodel is identifiable when there is little evidence of a breakpoint in the data.
Note that this results in the following analytic expression for $\pd_{2}(\phi_{2 \cap 3})$
\begin{equation}
  \pd_{3}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{N} \pd(\eta^{b}_{1, i}) \pd(\eta^{a}_{1, i}) \pd(\kappa_{i}), \,\, \text{with} \,\,\,
  \pd(\kappa_{i}) = \pd_{\kappa^{\text{raw}}_{i}}\left(\frac{\kappa_{i} - u_{i, (1)}}{r_{i}}\right) \frac{1}{r_{i}}
\end{equation}
by the change of variables formula.

Specifying a prior for $\eta_{0, i}$, the cumulative fluid balance at $\kappa_{i}$, is difficult because it too depends on the length of stay.
Instead, we reparameterise so that $\eta_{0, i}$ is a function of the y-intercept $\eta_{0, i}^{\text{raw}}$.
\begin{equation}
  \eta_{0, i} =
    (\eta_{0, i}^{\text{raw}} + \eta^{b}_{1, i} \kappa_{i}) \boldsymbol{1}_{\{0 < \kappa_{i}\}} +
    (\eta_{0, i}^{\text{raw}} + \eta^{a}_{1, i} \kappa_{i}) \boldsymbol{1}_{\{0 \geq \kappa_{i}\}}
\end{equation}
We place a $\text{LogNormal}(1.61, 0.47^2)$ prior on $\eta_{0, i}^{\text{raw}}$.
These values are obtained assuming that, a priori, the $2.5\%, 50\%$, and $99\%$ percentiles of $\eta_{0, i}^{\text{raw}}$ are $0.5, 5$, and $15$ respectively [@belgorodski_rriskdistributions_2017].
This is a broad prior that reflects the numerous possible admission routes into the ICU.
We expect those admitted from the wards to have little pre-admission fluid data.
Those admitted from the operating theatre occasionally have their in-theatre fluid input recorded after admission into the ICU, with no easy way to distinguish these records in the data.

## A comparison with the competing risk approach

An alternative approach is to consider a competing risks model for $\pd_{2}$, where each individual experiences either the respiratory failure event or the competing, non-independent event of death or discharge [see Chapter 8 of @kalbfleisch_statistical_2002 for an introduction].
However, issues arise due to the difference in supports between $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ and $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$; aligning the supports requires conditioning on $C_{i}$ (the length of stay) in $\pd_{2}$.
Conditional on $C_{i}$, the death or discharge event can only happen at a known, fixed time, which violates the competing risk assumption (that each event can occur at any moment in time the individual is exposed to both risks).
In light of this, we feel that it is more correct to consider the time of death or discharge as a censoring time.
Standard survival analyses arguments show us that these approaches are equivalent subject to certain assumptions.
However, one key these arguments make is that the survival times and indicators $(T_{i}, d_{i})$ must be known/fixed quantities.
This assumption is not valid in our example, and below we show why this invalidates the usual equivalence between the competing risk and censoring approaches.

Suppose that each individual $i$ experiences one of $d_{i} = 1, 2$ competing risks.
We observe $\{T_{i}, d_{i}\}$, where $d_{i} = 1$ indicates that individual $i$ experienced respiratory failure at time $T_{i}$.
If $d_{i} = 2$ then individual $i$ expired or was discharged at time $T_{i}$, noting that this event must occur at time $C_{i}$.
Each cause-specific hazard has parameters $\theta_{d_{i}}$ and we denote the hazard $h_{i, d_{i}}(t \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})$.
Denote $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\theta_{1}, \theta_{2})$ and assume only one such event can occur at a time so that
\begin{gather}
  h_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) = \sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} h_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}), \\
  \begin{aligned}
  H_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})
    &= \int_{0}^{T_{i}} \sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} h_{i, d_{i}}(u \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \text{d}u \\
    &= \sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} \int_{0}^{T_{i}} h_{i, d_{i}}(u \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \text{d}u \\
    &= \sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} H_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}),
  \end{aligned} \\
  S_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})
    = \exp\left\{-H_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})\right\}
    = \exp\left\{-\sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} H_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})\right\}.
\end{gather}
As per Equation (8.8) in @kalbfleisch_statistical_2002 the likelihood function for a specific individual is
\begin{align*}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})
    &= h_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) S_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \\
    &= h_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \exp\left\{-\sum_{d_{i} \in \{1, 2\}} H_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})\right\}.
\end{align*}

It is now necessary to assume

- that there are no shared elements in $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$ and they are a priori independent,
- that $\theta_{2}$ is not of interest, i.e. we wish to integrate/marginalise $\theta_{2}$ out of the likelihood.

The model (given covariates $\boldsymbol{w}_{i}$) is

\begin{equation}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i}, \boldsymbol{\theta} \mid \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) =
    \pd(T_{i}, d_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i})\pd(\boldsymbol{\theta}).
\end{equation}

We are interested in the following marginal

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i}, \theta_{1} \mid \boldsymbol{w}_{i})
  &= \int \pd(T_{i}, d_{i}, \boldsymbol{\theta} \mid \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \text{d}\theta_{2} \\
  &= \int h_{i, d_{i}}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{d_{i}}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) S_{i}(T_{i} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \pd(\theta_{1}) \pd(\theta_{2}) \text{d}\theta_{2}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
If $d_{i} = 1$
\begin{multline}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i}, \theta_{1} \mid \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) = \\
    h_{i, 1}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{1}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) S_{i, 1}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{1}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \pd(\theta_{1}) \int S_{i, 2}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{2}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \pd(\theta_{2}) \text{d} \theta_{2},
  \label{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-one}
\end{multline}
and if $d_{i} = 2$
\begin{multline}
  \pd(T_{i}, d_{i}, \theta_{1} \mid \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) = \\
    S_{i, 1}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{1}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \pd(\theta_{1}) \int h_{i, 2}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{2}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) S_{i, 2}(T_{i} \mid \theta_{2}, \boldsymbol{w}_{i}) \pd(\theta_{2}) \text{d} \theta_{2}.
  \label{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-two}
\end{multline}
Standard survival analyses consider $T_{i}$ as data.
Under this assumption the integrals in \eqref{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-one} and \eqref{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-two} are constants that do not depend on the parameters of interest, and can be ignored when maximising the likelihood for $\theta_{1}$.
The remaining components of \eqref{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-one} and \eqref{eqn:competing-risks-deriv-two} comprise the likelihood that would be obtained by considering all non $d_{i} = 1$ events as censored.
However, in our case $T_{i}$ is a parameter, and hence the integrals are non-ignorable functions of $T_{i}$.
This implies that the censoring model and the competing risks model are not equivalent, which we observed when comparing the posterior distributions for $(\gamma, \boldsymbol{\theta}, \alpha)$ under both models (not shown here).

## Analytic form for the survival function

The hazard at arbitrary time $t$ is

\begin{gather*}
  h_{i}(t) = \gamma t^{\gamma - 1} \exp\left\{\boldsymbol{w}_{i}\theta + \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial t} m_{i}(t)\right\} \\
  m_{i}(t) = \eta_{0, i} + \eta^{b}_{1, i}(t - \kappa_{i})\boldsymbol{1}_{\{t < \kappa_{i}\}} + \eta^{a}_{1, i}(t - \kappa_{i})\boldsymbol{1}_{\{t \geq \kappa_{i}\}} \\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} m_{i}(t) = \eta^{b}_{1, i}\boldsymbol{1}_{\{t < \kappa_{i}\}} + \eta^{a}_{1, i}\boldsymbol{1}_{\{t \geq \kappa_{i}\}}.
\end{gather*}

Then, for $t > \kappa_{i}$, the cumulative hazard is

\begin{align*}
  \int_{0}^{t} h_{i}(u) \text{d}u
  &= \int_{0}^{t}
    \gamma u^{\gamma - 1}
    \exp\left\{
      \boldsymbol{w}_{i}\theta +
      \alpha \eta^{b}_{1, i}\boldsymbol{1}_{\{u < \kappa_{i}\}} +
      \alpha \eta^{a}_{1, i}\boldsymbol{1}_{\{u \geq \kappa_{i}\}}
    \right\}
    \text{d}u \\
  &= \gamma \exp\{\boldsymbol{w}_{i}\theta\}
    \int_{0}^{t}
      u^{\gamma - 1}
      \exp\left\{
        \alpha \eta^{b}_{1, i}\boldsymbol{1}_{\{u < \kappa_{i}\}} +
        \alpha \eta^{a}_{1, i}\boldsymbol{1}_{\{u \geq \kappa_{i}\}}
      \right\}
    \text{d}u \\
  &= \gamma \exp\{\boldsymbol{w}_{i}\theta\}
    \left[
      \int_{0}^{\kappa_{i}}
        u^{\gamma - 1}
        \exp\left\{
          \alpha \eta^{b}_{1, i}
        \right\}
      \text{d}u
      +
      \int_{\kappa_{i}}^{t}
        u^{\gamma - 1}
        \exp\left\{
          \alpha \eta^{a}_{1, i}
        \right\}
      \text{d}u
    \right] \\
  &= \exp\{\boldsymbol{w}_{i}\theta\}
    \left[
      \exp\left\{
        \alpha \eta^{b}_{1, i}
      \right\}
      \kappa_{i}^{\gamma}
      +
      \exp\left\{
        \alpha \eta^{a}_{1, i}
      \right\}
      (t^{\gamma} - \kappa_{i}^{\gamma})
    \right]
\end{align*}

and for $t < \kappa_{i}$

\begin{align*}
  \int_{0}^{t} h_{i}(u) \text{d}u
  &= \gamma \exp\{\boldsymbol{w}_{i}\theta\}
    \left[
      \int_{0}^{t}
        u^{\gamma - 1}
        \exp\left\{
          \alpha \eta^{b}_{1, i}
        \right\}
      \text{d}u
    \right] \\
  &= \exp\{\boldsymbol{w}_{i}\theta\}
    \left[
      \exp\left\{
        \alpha \eta^{b}_{1, i}
      \right\}
      t_{i}^{\gamma}
    \right] \\
  &= t_{i}^{\gamma} \exp\{\boldsymbol{w}_{i}\theta + \alpha \eta^{b}_{1, i}\}.
\end{align*}
The survival functions are defined with appropriately for $t > \kappa_{i}$ and $t < \kappa_{i}$ as $S_{i}(t) = \exp\{-\int_{0}^{t} h_{i}(u) \text{d}u\}$.

## Survival submodel prior justification {#p2-prior-justification}

Our prior for $(\gamma, \alpha, \boldsymbol{\theta})$ must result in a plausible distribution for $\pd_{2, i}(T_{i} \mid d_{i} = 1)$, and a reasonable balance between $d_{i} = 1$ and $d_{i} = 0$ events.
The primary concern is unintentionally specifying a prior for which the bulk of $\pd_{2, i}(T_{i} \mid d_{i} = 1)$ is very close to zero.
In addition, certain extreme configurations of $(\gamma, \alpha, \boldsymbol{\theta})$ cause issues for the methodology of @crowther_simulating_2013, particularly the numerical root finding and numerical integration steps.
We would like to rule out such extreme configurations a priori.
Ideally we would encode this information a joint prior for $(\gamma, \alpha, \boldsymbol{\theta})$, but specifying the appropriate correlation structure for these parameters is prohibitively challenging.
Instead we focus on specifying appropriate marginals for each of $\gamma, \alpha$, and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, and create visual prior predictive checks [@gabry_visualization_2019; @gelman_bayesian_2020] to ensure the induced prior for $(T_{i}, d_{i})$ is acceptable.

Before justifying our chosen marginal priors is, we note that the $\exp\{\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\theta + \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial T_{i}} m_{i}(T_{i})\}$ term implies that the priors for $\theta$ and $\alpha$ are on the log-scale.
Hence the magnitude of these parameters must be small, otherwise all event times would be very near zero or at infinity.
The non-symmetric effect of the transformation from the log scale also implies that symmetric priors are not obviously sensible.
From these observations we deduce that $\theta$ and $\alpha$ must not be too large in magnitude, however if they are negative then they can be slightly larger.
Hence, we specify the skew-normal priors detailed in Equation \eqref{eqn:surv-submodel-prior-def}, noting that the skewness parameter for $\alpha$ is smaller, because $\frac{\partial}{\partial T_{i}} m_{i}(T_{i})$ is strictly positive and typically between 0.5 and 20, whilst $\boldsymbol{w}_{i}$ is standardised to be approximately standard normal.
Lastly, if $\gamma$ is too far away from $1$ (in either direction), then the event times are very small either because the hazard increases rapidly ($\gamma \gg 1$), or because almost all of the cumulative hazard is in the neighbourhood of 0 ($\gamma \ll 1$).
We specify a gamma distribution for $\gamma$ with the $1$\textsuperscript{th}-, $50$\textsuperscript{th}-, and $99$\textsuperscript{th}-percentiles of $\pd_{2}(\gamma)$ are at $0.2, 1$, and $2$, allowing for a wide range of hazard shapes, but removing many of the extremes.


## Estimating submodel prior marginal distributions

### P/F submodel

We approximate $\pd_{1}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ using a mixture of discrete and continuous distributions, with a discrete spike at $C_{i}$ for the censored events and a beta distribution for the (rescaled) event times.
Monte Carlo samples of $T_{i}$ and $d_{i}$ are obtained from $\pd_{1, i}(T_{i}, d_{i})$ by drawing $\beta_{0, i}$ and $\boldsymbol{\zeta}_{i}$ from their respective prior distributions and then solving \eqref{eqn:event-time-model-def}.
Denoting the estimated mixture weight $\widehat{\pi}_{i} \in [0, 1]$, the density estimate is
\begin{equation}
  \widehat{\pd}_{1, i}(T_{i}, d_{i}) =
    \widehat{\pi}_{i} \, \text{Beta}\left(\frac{T_{i}}{C_{i}}; \widehat{a}, \widehat{b}\right) \frac{1}{C_{i}} \boldsymbol{1}_{\{d_{i} = 1\}} +
    (1 - \widehat{\pi}_{i}) \boldsymbol{1}_{\{d_{i} = 0, T_{i} = C_{i}\}}
  \label{eqn:pf-event-time-prior-dist}
\end{equation}
where $\widehat{\pi}_{i}, \widehat{a}_{i}$ and $\widehat{b}_{i}$ are maximum likelihood estimates obtained using the prior samples.
Examples of $\widehat{\pd}_{1, i}(T_{i}, d_{i})$ for a subset of individuals are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:pf_prior_fit}.

```{r pf_prior_fit, fig.cap = "Fitted distribution (curve) and Monte Carlo samples drawn from $\\pd_{1}(\\phi_{1 \\cap 2})$ (histogram) for a subset of the individuals in the cohort. The height of the atom at $C_{i}$ (red bar and point) has been set to $1 - \\widehat{\\pi}_{i}$"}

### Survival submodel

Our estimate of $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$ relies on the fact that $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{N}\pd_{2, i}(T_{i}, d_{i}, \kappa_{i}, \eta^{b}_{1, i}, \eta^{a}_{1, i})$.
As such we estimate $\pd_{2, i}(T_{i}, d_{i}, \kappa_{i}, \eta^{b}_{1, i}, \eta^{a}_{1, i})$ for each individual and take the product of these estimates.
Drawing samples from $\pd_{2, i}(T_{i}, d_{i}, \kappa_{i}, \eta^{b}_{1, i}, \eta^{a}_{1, i})$ is challenging: we use the approach proposed by @crowther_simulating_2013 as implemented in @brilleman_simsurv_2021.
Inspecting the samples reveals correlation between $(T_{i}, d_{i})$ and $(\kappa_{i}, \eta^{b}_{1, i}, \eta^{a}_{1, i})$ that we would like to capture in our estimate.
To do so, we fit a mixture of multivariate normal distributions to transformations of the continuous parameters with support on $\mathbb{R}$,
\begin{equation}
  \tilde{T}_{i} = \text{Logit}\left(\frac{T_{i}}{C_{i}}\right), \quad
  \tilde{\kappa}_{i} = \text{Logit}\left(\frac{\kappa_{i} - u_{i, (1)}}{u_{i, (n)} - u_{i, (1)}}\right), \quad
  \tilde{\eta}^{b}_{1, i} = \log(\eta^{b}_{1, i}), \quad
  \tilde{\eta}^{a}_{1, i} = \log(\eta^{a}_{1, i}).
\end{equation}
The resulting density estimate, with estimated mixture weight $\widehat{\theta}_{i} \in [0, 1]$, is
\begin{align*}
  \widehat{\pd}_{2}(T_{i}, d_{i}, \kappa_{i}, \eta^{b}_{1, i}, \eta^{a}_{1, i}) =
    \Big[&
      (\widehat{\theta}_{i})
      \text{N}\left(
        \left[\tilde{T}_{i}, \tilde{\kappa}_{i}, \tilde{\eta}^{b}_{1, i}, \tilde{\eta}^{a}_{1, i} \right]^{\mathsf{T}}; \widehat{\mu}_{1, i}, \widehat{\Sigma}_{1, i}
      \right)
      \boldsymbol{1}_{\{d_{i} = 1\}}
      + \\
      & (1 - \widehat{\theta}_{i})
      \text{N}\left(\left[\tilde{\kappa}_{i}, \tilde{\eta}^{b}_{1, i}, \tilde{\eta}^{a}_{1, i} \right]^{\mathsf{T}}; \widehat{\mu}_{0, i}, \widehat{\Sigma}_{0, i} \right)
      \boldsymbol{1}_{\{d_{i} = 0, T_{i} = C_{i}\}}
    \Big]
    J_{i},
\end{align*}
where $\widehat{\theta}_{i}, \widehat{\mu}_{1, i}, \widehat{\Sigma}_{1, i}, \widehat{\mu}_{0, i}$, and $\widehat{\Sigma}_{0, i}$ are maximum likelihood estimates, and the Jacobian correction $J_{i}$ is
\begin{equation}
  J_{i} = \left[
    \left(
      \frac{1}{C_{i} - T_{i}} +
      \frac{1}{T_{i}}
    \right)^{d_{i}}
    \left(
      \frac{1}{u_{i, (n)} - \kappa_{i}} +
      \frac{1}{\kappa_{i} - u_{i, (1)}}
    \right)
    \left(
      \frac{1}{\eta^{b}_{1, i}}
    \right)
    \left(
      \frac{1}{\eta^{a}_{1, i}}
    \right)
  \right].
\end{equation}

We asses the fit of this estimate by drawing samples from $\widehat{\pd}_{2, i}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3})$ and comparing them to the Monte Carlo samples drawn using `simsurv`.
Our visual assessment is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:surv_prior_plot_fit} for individual $i = 19$.
The normal approximation seems to fit the samples well, with the shape of $\pd_{2, i}(T_{i} \mid d_{i} = 1)$ closely matching that of the Monte Carlo samples, and with a similar mix of $d_{i} = 0$ and $d_{i} = 1$ samples.

We also require an estimate of $\pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2})$ for experiments discussed in Section \ref{results}.
This is obtained using the samples generated under the survival submodel prior and the methodology of Section \ref{pf-submodel}.
The raw samples and fit are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:surv_prior_phi_12_marginal_plot_fit}.

```{r surv_prior_phi_12_marginal_plot_fit, fig.cap = "Fitted distribution (curve) and Monte Carlo samples drawn from $\\pd_{2}(\\phi_{1 \\cap 2})$ (histogram) for a subset of the individuals in the cohort.

## Cohort selection criteria

This appendix details the cohort selection criteria and our rationale for them.
In the text we speak of the $i$\textsuperscript{th} individual.
This is because in our final data set (the data that results from applying the following criteria) we are dealing with unique individuals, however some individuals in MIMIC have multiple ICU stays.
In this appendix $i$ represents a single stay in ICU.

1. Each ICU stay must have at least 12 PF observations ($J_{i} \geq 12$), with the first 6 being greater than 350 ($z_{i, j} > 350$ for $j = 1, \dots, 1$).
    - This is to ensure we have enough data to fit a B-spline with 7 internal knots. The restriction on the first 6 observations is to avoid selecting those who have already started to experience respiratory failure prior to ICU admission.
1. The time between any 2 consecutive PF observations cannot exceed 2 days.
    - This is because we believe this lack of PF observations is likely to be an error in the data: e.g. what appears as a single ICU stay in the data is actually two or more separate stays.
1. The fluid observations must be after ICU admission (some observations are entered as 'Pre-admission intake') and cannot be associated with fluid administered in the operating room (OR). Note that this does not mean all OR fluid administrations are removed, as some are mis-labelled.
1. There must be sufficient temporal overlap between the fluid data and the PF data. Specifically,
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{
      \max\left\{0, \min\left[\max(\boldsymbol{t}_{i}), \max(\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i})\right] - \max\left[\min(\boldsymbol{t}_{i}), \min(\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i})\right]\right\}
    } {
      \max\left[\max(\boldsymbol{t}_{i}), \max(\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i})\right] - \min\left[\min(\boldsymbol{t}_{i}), \min(\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}_{i})\right]
    }
    > 0.9
    \label{eqn:overlap-def}
  \end{equation}
    - The numerator of \eqref{eqn:overlap-def} is strictly positive, and the denominator ensures that the quantity is bounded between 0 and 1.
    - We cannot investigate the relationship between the rate of fluid intake and respiratory failure if the latter occurs without sufficient fluid data surrounding the event.

## Baseline covariate information

The baseline covariate vector $\boldsymbol{w}_{i}$ contains the median of the measurements taken in the first 24 hours of the ICU stay, which are then stardardised, of the following covariates: Anion gap, Bicarbonate, Creatinine, Chloride, Glucose, Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, Platelet, Partial thromboplastin time, International normalized ratio, Prothrombin time, Sodium, blood Urea nitrogen, White blood cell count, Age at ICU admission, and Gender.

## Updating $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\phi_{2 \cap 3}$ in stage two individual-at-a-time {#one-at-a-time}

The parallel sampler described in Section \ref{parallel-sampler} is a MH-within-Gibbs scheme, with each iteration sampling from the  conditionals of the melded model
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
  \pd_{\text{meld}}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \psi_{1} \mid \boldsymbol{Y}, \psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{3}), \\
  \pd_{\text{meld}}(\phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{3} \mid \boldsymbol{Y}, \phi_{1 \cap 2}, \psi_{1}, \psi_{2}), \\
  \pd_{\text{meld}}(\psi_{2} \mid \boldsymbol{Y}, \phi_{1 \cap 2}, \psi_{1}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{3}).
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
We would like to update the first two conditionals 'individual-at-a-time'.
For simplicity we will assume the pooled prior is formed using product-of-experts pooling, and focus on the first conditional $\pd_{\text{meld}}(\phi_{1 \cap 2}, \psi_{1} \mid \boldsymbol{Y}, \psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{3})$.
Similar arguments apply to the second conditional and other pooling types.
Recall that
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\phi_{1 \cap 2} &=
  (\phi_{1 \cap 2, 1}, \ldots, \phi_{1 \cap 2, N})  \\
  &= (\phi_{1 \cap 2, 1}(\chi_{1, 1}), \ldots, \phi_{1 \cap 2, N}(\chi_{1, N})) \\
  &= \left((T_{1}, d_{1}), \ldots, (T_{N}, d_{N})\right),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and $\psi_{1} = (\psi_{1, 1}, \ldots, \psi_{1, N}) = (\omega_{i})_{i = 1}^{N}$.
We would like to update $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$ and $\psi_{1}$ by updating $(T_{i}, d_{i}, \omega_{i})$ for one individual at a time, for a total of $N$ 'sub-steps'.

### Sub-step 1

Suppose we are at step $t - 1$ of the Markov chain, and we are proposing values for step $t$.
Without any loss of generality we assume that we are updating individual $i = 1$ in sub-step 1 -- in practice we update the individuals in a random order for each iteration of the MH-within-Gibbs scheme.

Our target is
\begin{equation}
  \pd_{1}(\chi_{1, 1}, \psi_{1, 1} \mid Y_{1}, (\chi_{1, i}, \psi_{1, i})_{i = 2}^{N})
  \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2, 1}(\chi_{1, 1}) \mid Y_{2}, (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}))_{i = 2}^{N}, \psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}).
  \label{eqn:sub-step-target}
\end{equation}
The model, detailed in \eqref{eqn:pf-model-def} and \eqref{eqn:pf-model-priors-simple}, factorises such that
\begin{equation}
  \pd_{1}(\chi_{1}, \psi_{1} \mid Y_{1}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{N} \pd_{1}(\chi_{1, i}, \psi_{1, i} \mid Y_{1}),
\end{equation}
which implies[^fluidproperty] $(\chi_{1, i}, \psi_{1, i}\indep \chi_{1, i^{'}}, \psi_{1, i^{'}}) \mid Y_{1}$ for $i \neq i^{'}$, hence
\begin{equation}
  \pd_{1}(\chi_{1, 1}, \psi_{1, 1} \mid Y_{1}, (\chi_{1, i}, \psi_{1, i})_{i = 2}^{N}) =
  \pd_{1}(\chi_{1, 1}, \psi_{1, 1} \mid Y_{1}).
\end{equation}
It will be convenient to rewrite \eqref{eqn:sub-step-target} as
\begin{equation}
  \pd_{1}(\chi_{1, 1}, \psi_{1, 1} \mid Y_{1})
  \frac {
    \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2, 1}(\chi_{1, 1}), (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}))_{i = 2}^{N}, \psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3} \mid Y_{2})
  } {
    \pd_{2}((\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}))_{i = 2}^{N}, \psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3} \mid Y_{2})
  }.

[^fluidproperty]: This property is also true of $\pd_{3}$.

Suppose there are $K_{1}$ stage one samples from $\pd_{1}(\chi_{1}, \psi_{1} \mid Y_{1})$, and each sample has a corresponding $\phi_{1 \cap 2}$.
We propose $\psi_{1, 1}^{*}$ and $\chi_{1, 1}^{*}$ (hence $\phi_{1 \cap 2, 1}^{*})$ by sampling a random integer $k_{1}^{*}$ from $\{1, \ldots, K_{1}\}$, retrieving the corresponding values of $\psi_{1}$ and $\chi_{1}$, and ignoring $(\chi_{1, 2}, \ldots, \chi_{1, N}, \psi_{1, 2}, \ldots, \psi_{1, N})$.
This is equivalent to proposing from $\pd_{1}(\chi_{1, 1}, \psi_{1, 1} \mid Y_{1})$
Under this proposal, noting that the denominator term in \eqref{eqn:sub-step-one-target} does not depend on the proposed parameters, the acceptance probability for this sub-step is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\alpha&\left((\chi_{1, 1}^{*}, \psi_{1}^{*})_{k_{1}^{*}}, (\chi_{1, 1}, \psi_{1}) \right) \\
&=
\frac {
  \pd_{1}(\chi_{1, 1}^{*}, \psi_{1, 1}^{*} \mid Y_{1})
  \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2, 1}(\chi_{1, 1}^{*}), (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}))_{i = 2}^{N}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{2} \mid Y_{2})
} {
  \pd_{1}(\chi_{1, 1}, \psi_{1, 1} \mid Y_{1})
  \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2, 1}(\chi_{1, 1}), (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}))_{i = 2}^{N}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{2} \mid Y_{2})
}
\frac{
  \pd_{1}(\chi_{1, 1}, \psi_{1} \mid Y_{1})
} {
  \pd_{1}(\chi_{1, 1}^{*}, \psi_{1}^{*} \mid Y_{1})
} \\
&= \frac {
  \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2, 1}(\chi_{1, 1}^{*}), (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}))_{i = 2}^{N}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{2} \mid Y_{2})
} {
  \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2, 1}(\chi_{1, 1}), (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}))_{i = 2}^{N}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, \psi_{2} \mid Y_{2})
},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which does not depend on $\pd_{1}$.
We store the value of $k_{1}^{*}$ associated with the proposal (if it is accepted) in order to resample the stage one values of $\psi_{1, 1}$ to reflect the information in the other submodels.

### Sub-step $n$

At sub-step $n$, for $1 < n \leq N$ with $(\chi_{1, i})_{i = N + 1}^{N} = \varnothing$, we have updated $((\chi_{1, i}, \psi_{1, i})_{i = 1}^{n - 1})$ to $((\chi_{1, i}^{[t]}, \psi_{1, i}^{[t]})_{i = 1}^{n - 1})$.
Thus the target is
\begin{align}
  \pd_{1} & \left(\chi_{1, n}, \psi_{1, n} \mid Y_{1}, (\chi_{1, i}^{[t]}, \psi_{1, i}^{[t]})_{i = 1}^{n - 1}, (\chi_{1, i}, \psi_{1, i})_{i = n + 1}^{N}\right) \\
  & \times \pd_{2} \left(\phi_{1 \cap 2, n}(\chi_{1, n}) \mid Y_{2}, \psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}^{[t]}))_{i = 1}^{n - 1}, (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}))_{i = n + 1}^{N}\right)
  \nonumber \\
  = & \pd_{1} \left(\chi_{1, n}, \psi_{1, n}, \mid Y_{1} \right)
  \frac {
    \pd_{2} \left(\phi_{1 \cap 2, n}(\chi_{1, n}), \psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}^{[t]}))_{i = 1}^{n - 1}, (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}))_{i = n + 1}^{N} \mid Y_{2}\right)
  } {
    \pd_{2} \left(\psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}^{[t]}))_{i = 1}^{n - 1}, (\phi_{1 \cap 2, i}(\chi_{1, i}))_{i = n + 1}^{N} \mid Y_{2}\right)
  }
  \label{eqn:two-to-N-target}
\end{align}
We propose $\chi_{1, n}^{*}, \psi_{1, n}^{*}$ in the same manner as the previous section.
The corresponding acceptance probability is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\alpha ((\chi_{1, n}^{*}, \psi_{1, n}^{*}), & (\chi_{1, n}, \psi_{1, n}) )  \\
= &\frac {
  \pd_{1} \left(\chi_{1, n}^{*}, \psi_{1, n}^{*} \mid Y_{1} \right)
} {
  \pd_{1} \left(\chi_{1, n}, \psi_{1, n} \mid Y_{1} \right)
} \\
& \times \frac {
  \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2, n}(\chi_{1, n}^{*}), \psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, (\chi_{1, i}^{[t]})_{i = 1}^{n - 1}, (\chi_{1, i})_{i = n + 1}^{N} \mid Y_{2})
} {
  \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2, n}(\chi_{1, n}), \psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, (\chi_{1, i}^{[t]})_{i = 1}^{n - 1}, (\chi_{1, i})_{i = n + 1}^{N} \mid Y_{2})
} \\
& \times \frac{
  \pd_{1}(\chi_{1, n}, \psi_{1, n} \mid Y_{1})
} {
  \pd_{1}(\chi_{1, n}^{*}, \psi_{1, n}^{*} \mid Y_{1})
} \\
= &\frac {
  \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2, n}(\chi_{1, n}^{*}), \psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, (\chi_{1, i}^{[t]})_{i = 1}^{n - 1}, (\chi_{1, i})_{i = n + 1}^{N} \mid Y_{2})
} {
  \pd_{2}(\phi_{1 \cap 2, n}(\chi_{1, n}), \psi_{2}, \phi_{2 \cap 3}, (\chi_{1, i}^{[t]})_{i = 1}^{n - 1}, (\chi_{1, i})_{i = n + 1}^{N} \mid Y_{2})
}.
